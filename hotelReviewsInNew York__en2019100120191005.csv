0,"It is hard to beat this location. The hotel is close to restaurants, shopping and a short walk from the High Line and Hudson Yards. The hotel itself was ok. Not super fancy, but everything you need. Our room was clean, the bed was comfortable and our AC was just fine. So no major hickup with the room. That being said, this is not the Ritz or the 4 season. If you are looking for pampering and fancy, there are better options, but be ready to pay for those options! The rooftop bar was fun and inviting and the food served was good. Never had an issue with the staff, they were all nice and helpful. I can't think of anywhere else I would like to stay, location is everything. I will certainly consider this hotel on my next trip .","July 7, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

1,Stayed two nights. AC did not work in lobby or room. Several times called and stopped at front desk. They said they would send maintenance every time. It never happened. It was a cool 81 degrees in the room and staff would not move us or get the AC issue fixed. Room 1000 in case you wonder. Security staff was also rude and unprofessional. I have never been treated so poorly by the staff in a hotel I was staying in. Rooftop bar was average. Weak drinks and overpriced $19 cocktails.,"July 7, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

2,"I used to live in the neighborhood and wanted to stay here on a return trip. I knew the rooms and the hotel itself were nice (and great location) so booked my 6 nights here. I should've known something was up when, on arrival, I walked into the lobby that was warm, humid and stuffy - and they even had fans sitting on the checkin counter pointing towards the staff. But it was typical NYC summer weather - hot and humid - and normally when you walk into a hotel lobby it's like a respite from the heat (and this was at 7pm, not the peak of the day).My room was at 72 degrees but humid & still so I set the A/C down to 65. Nothing happened. Set to 60. Set to 50. Nothing happened. Went out for 2 hours thinking it would be cooler when I got back, and when I got back it was the same. I realized that the A/C just wasn't working or in the very least, wasn't working enough to cool the room. I went to the front desk and asked them to switch me to a room with A/C and they were 100% booked but offered me a fan. A fan. This is the most basic room at $450/night, and... a fan? But I had no choice, it was already approaching midnight and it was too late to find something else, so I took it. They promised to switch me to a room the next day.The next day: they have a room and they promise that the AC is working great. I tell them ""I bet it's not - can you please have someone check to confirm"" - and the guy says ""Even our engineer was up there servicing it, he said it's cranking."" So I go up to that room and it's almost 80 degrees according to the thermometer - but they said it was cranking? I went back to the front desk with a photo of the thermometer and they said ""it takes a little bit to cool down but should be fine soon."" So I went out for a few hours and came back, and barely any change: 77 degrees. Humid, still. Back to the front desk with photo proof and they say they have another room (3rd room within a 24 hour period) that is a slightly upgraded room (space-wise just a tiny couch by the window) and they promise that the AC is working great in this one. I get to the room and it's the same thing: temp stuck at 72 (humid) degrees and I set the thermometer down to 50 and nothing happens. I go back to the front desk and tell them ""I'm really not trying to make your lives miserable, I just want the AC to work."" The engineer comes up to the room, walks in and says ""it's really cold in here"" (it's not: when you walk in it's like the humidity and stillness close in around you). He checks the air temp coming out of the vents and it's at 54-58 degrees, but the room is stuck at 72 - this just means that the AC isn't strong enough to cool the (small) room. The manager comes up to check it himself (who was incredibly nice) and found the temperature to be acceptable - not cold, but comfortable and temperate. This was a week in NYC where it was 92 and 90% humidity every day, lows of 80 each night, and I needed normal air conditioning. I couldn't imagine staying here 5 more nights, so I accepted a fan for night two and told them I'd be checking into a different hotel for the remainder of my stay (and lucky enough I was able to find one nearby with room availability). They understood and were kind enough to let me out of my remaining nights' commitment, but I think that's the right thing to do if a room's AC isn't working properly. A luxury hotel should have A/C that chills a room - for example, a nearby hotel allows you to set the thermostat down to 60 and you feel the temp change quickly. In the heat of an NYC summer, 66-68 is a perfect room temperature to be able to sleep in. I was beginning to wonder if it was just me so I took to TripAdvisor and searched old reviews and found a lot of comments about poorly-functioning air conditioning, so it must just be something about their HVAC system. If A/C had been working normally I would've given this hotel a 4-4.5-star review, but minus AC in summertime in NYC, that rating has to drop. But it's balanced out a bit by the hotel realizing it was a problem and letting me cut my stay short. On other more complimentary fronts: very very nice staff here, helpful, friendly.","July 4, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

3,"WOW! Met my long distance girlfriend for a romantic getaway in NYC. The pictures, location and amenities drew us to Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC but the world-class service (especially Lauren at the front desk) the detail and cleanliness of the room (King Suite), the in-room balcony and the rooftop pool made our stay truly memorable! In fact, we just booked again for July and can’t wait!Everyone was super friendly and offered top-notch hospitality. Really excited to return later this month. Thanks Gansevoort - romantic, private, comfy and clean!","July 2, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

4,"I love the Gansevoort for the central location in the Meatpacking, with a quick walk into Chelsea or the West Village. Lauren at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful, and upgraded us from a standard king room into a nice suite for our stay. The added room definitely enabled us to enjoy our time at the hotel.","June 25, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

5,"We stayed at this hotel to celebrate our 15th anniversary and went with our friends who were celebrating their 10th. We spent extra for a suite in order to celebrate. Not only was the suite not worth the money, it was in shambles when compared to our friend’s regular room. The air conditioner was broken and couldn’t keep the room at a comfortable temperature for sleeping. A lamp shade was being held together with tape. The USB outlet was not functioning and we only had a USB cord for charging our phones. The furniture was old and worn. Our friend’s regular room was updated and a considerably better environment than our suite. We wished we didn’t spend so much more for what we thought would have been an upgrade.","June 23, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

6,This is the perfect hotel if you’re a returning visitor to New York or aren’t looking to do the typical tourist activities. The meatpacking district is a region teeming with quaint coffee houses and upscale eateries; not to mention the world renowned Chelsea market is visible from most rooms. But there is a loud bar downstairs which is open until late if you’re bothered by alcohol. The beds were extremely comfortable for a refuge after rigorous walking all day! ,"June 19, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

7,"I have found this review quite difficult to score as there are many good points so have went in the middle as I think ultimately there are a few real negatives.Firstly, fabulous location but wouldn’t recommend for a week as after a few days you find you need to travel everywhere. I think midtown best hotel location and can visit the cool districts like this and spend the day there which would be better.The rooftop pool is beautiful but food is barred. So when sunbathing and get hungry you must get dressed and go inside. Bit annoying.The rooftop bar has a great view but the staff are extremely rude especially the blonde and brunette ladies. There is no chat and they make you feel quite uncomfortable. I think this is outsourced and not actually hotel staff as the hotel staff are lovely at reception and the ground floor bars.The continental breakfast is the worst I have experienced. No ham or cheese. Just pastries and jam. Poor.The bar upstairs is also very expensive at $15 for a small water and draft coke. I don’t mind paying for value but a very basic drink.We had a terrace room with private seating area. But above you are lots of rooms who drop cigarettes down and the cleaners don’t pick up. It also isn’t relaxing sitting at night with hundreds of rooms above you with windows open and you would be a good target for drunk pranks below. Water pouring etc. As the hotel is full of youths. It also becomes almost a nightclub on Friday Saturdays so if not into a lobby full of clubbers maybe avoid.The cleaners ignore the bins in room if you don’t put everything in exact bin. Fairly annoying. Had to leave a $5 tip beside it and then it was emptied.Storage in room non existent. Nowhere to put two cases. Bathroom tiny and the way door works two people really struggled to even brush teeth together.4 star hotel with a smelly damp shower curtain seems odd too.Overall good experience and we had a great time but for having such a brand like Gansevoort I don’t think it was much better than any Hilton Garden Inn.If really want to stay here I would suggest 2 nights max and then switch hotel.

9,"Stayed here 3 nights for work and will keep coming back. Have been to all the nearby hotels (Dream, Maritime, Standard) but this was my first time at Gansevoort and it did not disappoint. The location is adorable and it sits on a cute street with a fun ice cream pop up in front, the service super friendly and helpful. (Special call outs to Charles and Raul that helped me with luggage and Lauren at the front desk, who helped me check in and check out and was super thoughtful to find me a quieter room since she knew I was in town for work, which was in stark contrast from the Dream, where they put me in a room with tons of noise from the pool even though I requested a quiet room when booking) everyone greets you, and the folks at the elevators that press the button for you are really a nice touch. The room was spacious and well-appointed with loccitane toiletries and the cutest slippers and a cute goose on the bed. :) I will definitely continue to book Gansevoort for future visits.

10,Just back from this amazing hotel. Great customer service. Staff can’t do enough for you to make your stay pleasurable. Really helpful and will advise on anything regarding the area. Only downside is that it’s expensive especially on the roof top bar. It gets really crowded on a sunny day so get up there early to bag a sofa. They started to play really loud music from 11am which was our time to exit! You wouldn’t want to stay up there all day anyway as there’s too much do outside the hotel. Great location for bars and make sure you take full advantage of the happy hours at Bubbys and Serfino as its makes a massive difference to the wallet as just doesn’t offer half price drinks but delicious bar snacks too!!! Would recommend based on location and amazing staff!,"June 1, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

13,"My family had a wonderful experience at the Gansevoort this past weekend. Kenya in reservations and Lauren at the front desk offered my family three rooms on the same floor, all with a view of the Hudson. In spite of the on again/off again rain, the view was spectacular. A birthday note, wine and chocolates were waiting for me in the room. All staff were super friendly. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms were quiet throughout the night. Loved the rooftop pool which had just re-opened. Water was warm enough for a swim in 45 F degree weather! Only minor complaint is that many items in the room required an extra charge - $2 for a coffee pod, $9 for Fuji water, $9.99 for music on the TV. It seems that a 4 star hotel could afford to offer these amenities at no charge.","May 14, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

15,"The hotel was amazing and beautiful and everyone was very kind but I have to say that Lauren at the front desk was exceptional. She went out of her way to make us feel welcome and make sure we were aware of all the amenities and best spots around the hotel. One night we were craving sushi and asked her for the best spot around. She not only told us her favorite spot she orders take out from, she took the time to pull up the website menu and look at some pictures of the interior to make sure it had exactly what we wanted since she has only ordered take out and didn’t want to lead us in the wrong direction. Being from the South we expect a high level of hospitality and Lauren made us feel right at home. I cannot recommend Lauren and the hotel enough!! Next trip we will choose the Gansevoort again and hope to see lauren :)","May 9, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

16,"For this first visit in NY with the family (previously only in NY on business trips) I reserved the Gansevoort. It turned out not only to be the best location ever to do the many things we wanted for a 48hrs walk and see, with many shops, restaurants and close to the High Line area.But most of all, let’s talk about the customer service at the Gansevoort.The most welcoming people ever!Upon arrival you are meet up with only smiling and helpful people willing to make your stay as pleasant and wonderful.This particularly point of attention gives another dimension and highlights the welcoming feel that you need in such a big city as New York.

18,"I had been to the Gansevoort for cocktails in the uber trendy roof bar a few years ago and always wanted to stay there, so booked in with the family from the 21st December to the 24th December last, and what a great choice that was. We were looked after royally from the moment we checked in to the moment we left, nothing as too much trouble, the Ganesvoort team provided us with a haven to return to every day after the Christmas madness of New York We had a 2 bed suite which was absolutely perfect for the kids and ourselves, the rooms were generous in size, super bathroom - the shower in the master also doubled as a steam room. I have stayed in many other NY Hotel’s over the years , particularly further up towards central park and to be very honest I had my best NY sleeps ever in the Gansevoort. The kids too had a ball , with the youngest doing laps of the roof top pool at 8am on Christmas Eve ! We had a schedule of activates when we are in NY and thanks to Lorenzo at the front desk for all the arrangements he made from airport pickups and transfers to restaurant reservations. The Hotel by the way is in a fantastic location , walking distance to the Whitney museum , Chelsea market, the high line etc. If you are vising NY for business or pleasure this is just one super Hotel in a fabulous part of Manhattan,. Thanks to all the Ganesvoort team from Elon and Jennifer to the housekeeping teams and to those of you in the bars and the restaurant.

19,"While I don’t claim to be an NYC expert, not have I lived in this city, I’ve visited too many times to count, and stayed in various areas. I really feel that as a tourist, this is the best neighborhood. It’s hip, trendy, vibrant, safe and fun. It also has some great stores, and incredible eateries. From its cobble stoned streets, to the highline, this is a great place to walk around, wonder, and even get a little lost.And in the heart of it all, is a gem of a hotel, the Gansevoort. Located with a perfect river view of the Hudson, and in a prime part of this neighborhood, the hotel is modern, and vibrant, the rooms are hip and yet functional, and it is somewhat reasonably priced all things considered. The rooftop offers a bar scene with a pool deck. While we were visiting the pool area was being remodeled, but everything else was functional.Across the streets and within a stones throw away, are some great places to visit, wonder around, or grab some food on the go, or a high end sit down meal. From Restoration Hardware, to the Highline, to leading restaurants like Catch, Tao, Buddahkhan, Fig and Olive, or coffee and a drink or meal at Starbucks Reserve, or the many eateries at Chelsea Market, the options are almost endless.The hotel can be quite a scene on a weekend and possibly some mid-week nights, but this adds to the ambience and creates an added vibe. And all thing said, it’s also a good hotel for families with kids, so there is certainly balance. The staff were very helpful and even though we had an issue with our room, it was handled quickly and efficiently by the front desk team, and with the level of care that we appreciated. I would definitely come back and stay here again!","April 14, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

28,"The Gansevoort is a relativelly small (by Manhattan standards) hotel steps from the High Line and the Whitney museum. It's a wonderful location for strolling through the west village, touring the high line, etc. Rooms are very large by NYC standards. They are extremely well appointed with more toiletries and amenities than normal. L'Occitane toiletries, fabulous robes and slippers, and all kinds of little surprise touches (including a stuffed goose on the bed, still not sure about that one). There is a lovely rooftop bar. Views are not the best in the city, but it was still a charming place to end our evening. The gym has peloton bikes and you can get spinning shoes at the front desk. Check out time is generous at noon. Beds were super comfortable. Room was very dark for sleeping but had excellent lighting overall. Very quiet.

31,"Let's face it--NYC is a place with a million hotels but not many you actually want to stay in. Most of the choices are old, look onto brick walls, or have rooms the size of closets. Gansevoort is in one of the best neighborhoods in town, is accessible to everything, has a hip vibe, and rooms you actually want to relax in while looking west over the Hudson River and the High Line. It would be a great choice anywhere, but in NYC it's one of the best.","February 5, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

32,"Rooms are clean, comfortable and relatively large for NYC. Our room had a river view and a seating area which we enjoyed.We were at the hotel during an unusually cold weekend in January. Cold air constantly poured in to the lobby and you could not really enjoy a drink in the freezing bar area.Food in the restaurant in mediocre. We had breakfast and our table cloth was filthy-- absolutely disgusting. I wonder if another company manages the restaurant. Fortunately there are plenty of options within walking distance.","February 4, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

34,"We decided to be ""tourists"" every year for our anniversary in January. We live so close to the city and never take advantage of all that it has to offer. We stayed this year in the Meatpacking District (which I think is a section of Chelsea but don't quote me on that) and it is THE PLACE TO STAY! It is within walking distance to everything. EVERYTHING!!! The hotel is very pretty and the security is A-1! At check-in, however, we encountered a not-so-nice agent who was determined to tell me that I booked a double-bedded room for my anniversary! REALLY!? You're telling the customer she's wrong? Well, as it turns out, the upgrade that I paid for in a package ONLY had double-bedded rooms that Erica (yes, the Erica that everyone is reading about and lauds because she's tremendously helpful) explained that the king rooms were sold out but PROMPTLY set us up for the next night and nights to follow with a king room with an extraordinary view! The other ladies and gentlemen were exceptional as well. Even upon check out, that initial agent had an issue with us. SMH She is THE ONLY DOWNFALL!! She, and she alone and for me only, was the reason the Gansevoort Hotel lost a star! Bad taste in my mouth kind of thing. Not accommodating AT ALL!! (pun intended) Don't get me wrong, any room is nice but the king grand deluxe is sweet! Roomy, clean and grand. And for those who tried - you DID my us very happy! Thank you.We pick a different area of NYC each year, but this place is worth another visit.","January 25, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

35,"We were attending a business meeting close by and chose this hotel due to the proximity to that venue. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is nicely decorated, new and clean, with an air of edginess. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated and the service is good. The bar at the top is nice and has an amazing view of the surrounding area and a nice selection of drinks, wine and beer. The hotel is in a great location within walking distance of the Chelsea Market, Greenwich Village and lots of interesting sites, shops and restaurants. You can even walk from here to Times Square if you are up for a long walk. The prices are lower than in most more centrally located hotels; the only drawback is that the restaurants and bars close at 11:00 PM, a bit early for NYC. Probably will go back when returning to the city.","January 22, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

36,I stayed here on a business trip. The room was clean and the staff was helpful. I will say they charge for everything in the room except the soap. The coffee pods are $2 apiece. They have a valet parking service with no in out privileges for $65 a day. Fair warning it took them an hour to get my car one time.

38,"The Gansevoort was unexpectedly charming with a retro euro flair. I arrived very early and Lauren at the front desk was very accommodating, friendly and her customer service was exceptional. Lauren assisted me with directions, restaurant recommendations and so much more! The rooftop bar (The Plunge Bar) is loungie & relaxing with breathtaking views and an incredible barrista who is an awesome mixologist! The on-site restaurant (The Chester) has a delicious French breakfast...just ask for Anthony (he is the best!). I enjoyed my stay and I even playing a game of billiards in the lobby lounge area. My only disappointments were the Salon/ Spa was closed and the coffee in the room was not free. Otherwise, the location/ food/ accommodations/ service and staff were excellent.

39,"This is a no nonsense and solid 4 star hotel in a terrific location right in the heart of the re-enlivened Meatpacking District. No restaurant in house to speak of but there are heaps of great restaurants within 500 meters, including both the heavily touristed Chelsea Market and the less obvious but great cheap eats at Gansevoort Market. For the ultimate coffee “experience”, try the Starbucks Reserve restaurant across the road. For the best coffee, Kobricks next door is best. The hotel itself has a brilliant rooftop bar. There is a ‘higher’ rooftop bar over at the Standard Hotel, but much more pretentious. All staff were impeccable. We’d return.","January 5, 2019","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

40,My second time to this Hotel and was there last year for the New Year’s Eve party. When arriving to front desk we were amazingly remember by surname by the admirable Lauren with her bright smile!! Wow !.....was shocked... she remembered our names. She dealt with the changes adeptly and accommodated us with a front view due room being delay for check in. Furthermore before checkout we had our Recovery Brunch at the Chester Restaurant and was met by Mercedes the Manager was so nice to come over and ask us our opinion and if we were ok? I mention to her that the Brunch was impeccable! I was so impressed with the food. Mercedes said she would mention it the chef. Had a better time this year with the Brunch Recovery meal.

41,"So, I just got back from my trip to NYC for a girls trip with my mom and my pup, Karl and a girlfriend and honestly, I loved the hotel! Everything was great! Great location, rooftop bar was so fun and everyone in the hotel was extremely friendly and efficient - only complaints (and I hate to do this but I have to be honest ) was the bed was a tad bit uncomfortable. Also, someone by the name of Julia answered the phone one time when I tried to connect to concierge (she was not concierge because I did ask) but she answered the phone and MY GOD! Her responses were “yeah” one time too many. She was very rude . I recommend her not answering the phones anymore or possibly taking a class in phone etiquette . Other than that, everyone was FANTASTIC! Melvin is the NICEST person they have working there!!! He is just so friendly and accommodating . Even allowed us a late checkout ! The staff was great with my pupper, they were always welcoming us with smiles and salutations whenever we walked into the hotel. They had a bed and bowls (and even a squeaky toy) set up for Karl! Also, if you’re traveling with your furry companion and they are on the “service dog registry” they do get to stay for FREE ! Just bring your documentation !!!! Love that!!! I will definitely be back!!! Great location, great atmosphere!!! 1000% happy we took a trip up to NYC!","December 17, 2018","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

42,"The hotel is swanky, the service was fantastic, and the location was terrific. I especially loved the fact that the rooms had flat irons in addition to hair dryers. There was a button near the bed that allowed me to open and close the curtains without having to get up. The bathroom was spacious. The only thing I would have improved in the room was the actual bed. It wasn't comfortable, but the pillows were. I'd like to return in warmer weather so I can take advantage of the rooftop pool.","December 12, 2018","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

44,"There is absolutely nothing bad I can say about this place. Everything from the prompt valet out front on ninth Avenue to the endless room amenities, this is the place to stay. I dealt with Sonia and I must say she is one of the most accommodating young ladies I’ve ever dealt with in any resort. There are truly no apologies to be made about this place. The room was perfect, it was spotless and extremely comfortable. You are a short walk from a number of reputable and star-studded restaurants. There is a gorgeous roof top which I promise you will find exciting. If it’s within your means try to get yourself a Manhattan suite. The Chester downstairs is very convenient and delicious as well. If you favor Mexican food definitely walk next-door to Dos Caminos, they never disappoint. Do yourself a favor and make this your weekend destination the next time you are downtown.","December 4, 2018","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

45,"Booked this hotel for a special birthday treat. Booked 2 rooms so not a cheap trip. Nice rooms, lovely roof top pool but staff just so indifferent to guests. Had a few issues which were eventually dealt with but just got the overall impression we were a nuisance.Have emailed hotel twice since returning to question extra charges on bill and nobody has had the courtesy to reply. This hotel needs to decide whether it is an upmarket hotel or a party venue. The bar downstairs was always packed with non residents, sports was on the tv, it was over poweringly loud. There were lots of non residents going up to the roof of a night which compromised security within the building. Just felt that the hotel guests were an after thought, Perfectly located but would never stay here again.","November 21, 2018","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

46,"I stayed here for Marathon weekend with my husband and college-aged son. We also had a room for my parents' birthday gift. We were warmly welcomed by Charles the doorman who took care of us all whenever we arrived or left. He was very attentive getting a taxi and helping me with an umbrella or giving us water bottles before we went to watch the marathon. At the desk Melvin was also very accommodating. He was able to upgrade our rooms and made sure my parents were taken care of. The rooms were well appointed and spacious with a great view. My only complaint was that since the hotel is in such a popular area, there was a lot of noise from the rooftop bars and traffic until 3 am. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay there again!","November 9, 2018","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

Booked through a travel director (Passport to Friday) and we got a welcome champagne and food credit! Our room had an amazing view of the Meatpacking District and everything was super clean. Wish the beds were a tad comfier, but it's a small complaint considering it was an overall wonderful property.The hotel bar is the PLACE TO BE at night, so many people watching college football and just hanging out.

48,"Surrounded by the exciting Meatpacking district, a stay at the Gansevoort lets you walk to wonderful restaurants and enjoyable shopping. The Rooftop Bar offers hours of breathtaking views any time of the day. Sunset over the Hudson River makes for a very special cocktail experience.Surprisingly, the one downside is that the service is spotty at best. One moment you have a very helpful server, going the extra mile, but the next moment a staff member is too busy performing administrative tasks to take your order. Also, the hotel was experiencing difficulties with its HVAC system which made for one very uncomfortable night in a room which was way too hot. Those things happen, but when we reported the issue to the front desk I was told that ""an engineer will be sent up to fix the situation"". When I inquired as to status a couple of hours later that same front desk person said they forgot to send the engineer up! When I inquired yet again later that evening I was then told that the entire system was down. All in all, very disappointing treatment.","November 7, 2018","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

50,"We stayed 2 nights at the Gansevoort. The location is excellent. The staff in the hotel is very friendly. We had afternoon drinks at the rooftop bar. It is a comfortable space with excellent views, but the staff seemed to be bothered by us. Our room was very comfortable and clean and I am picky. One thing that really bothered me about our room was how the ""extras"" that were in our room had a price tag on them. Now, I know the mini bar and Fiji water will cost, but why put a goose Beanie Baby on my bed with a $10 price tag? $15.00 for Shaving kit, package of panties in the bathroom for a fee??!! Also, the in room coffee maker was $2.00 per Kcup! It just makes me feel like a money tree, not a guest when hotels do greedy things like this. Also, the entire Meatpacking District is very trendy. The Gansevoort caters to the young, hip crowd. We are an older middle aged couple with a 14 year old daughter and we felt out of place there. Overall our experience was positive, but I will be staying elsewhere next time.","October 21, 2018","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

51,"i've recently left new york after living here for 6 years and will always have fond memories of the meatpacking district. The gansevoort is among 3 of my favorite hotels in the area, as well as the city. The staff - particularly Yulia, at the front desk was so welcoming on my single night's stay. The lobby bar stays cozy, the rooftop bar is enclosed so you can still enjoy that autumn sun, but avoid the autumn wind. drinks are tasty, bartenders on both levels are helpful and kind and bellhops are prompt. Even with the construction that's currently blocking the 9th ave entrance, they were helpful in getting me and my items curbside and loaded up BEFORE the crack of dawn. the suite is well equipped and well laid out for privacy, but almost a little too inviting for visitors to dwell in the living room area ;). You're 10 minutes or less walking distance from some delicious restaurants - at all price points - and barely blocks away from shopping and fun.","October 17, 2018","0    Gansevoort Meatpacking NYC

Came back to my room after a long day of traveling since 4am and working, and it took 5 phone calls to room service and 2 calls to the front desk to place an in room dining order, where I asked for a glass of tap water with my meal and received a $10 bottle of Fiji instead (definitely was charged for it too). Not my typical stay during a business trip, also tried to entertain a colleague at downstairs bar, they didn’t have either drink we ordered at first.

57,"My husband and I travel 6 times a year, 3 internationally. Our experience with IHG has varied from excellent to disappointing. We rented two adjoining rooms with granddaughters on June 19, 20 and 21 at the Crown Plaza Times with points and cash. I had called and e-mailed at least two times to secure adjoining rooms with children. They assured me there would be no problem. The receptionist was short and rather curt indicating no quarantee of adjoining rooms although she did give it to us. Points cost 60,000 (a lot) per night, plus $23 property fee and $40 destination fee per room per night. That is equivalent to about $550 per night. The lights went on and off, faulty bulbs, in both rooms, the shower was either very hot or very cold, carpet was dingy. The room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. No room refrigerator or make-up mirror.

59,"We stayed for 4 nights, having booked a package of a Cunard cruise and this hotel. Before we even travelled I had a bad expereince; as my wife is diabetic and needs a small fridge in a hotel room to store insulin, I e-mailed the hotel to ask if rooms already contained a fridge; they couldn't even be bothered to reply. On arrival at the hotel we had to wait an age for our room to be ready, when it finally was I phoned down requesting a small fridge; they promised to bring one """"in a few minutes""; it actually took nearly 3 hours! Then I discovered that the safe in the room didn't work; I followed the instructions faithfully but nothing doing; on phoning down for ""service"" I was told in a very condescending way that I must have swiped my card the wrong way round; when after yet another long wait - an hour and a half - someone came to our room to look at it, he spotted straight away that it was broken and sent me down to the reception to ask for a safe deposit box at that level - hugely inconvenient. On the second day they removed all the large towels from the bathroom, even though we had not placed them on the floor and were perfectly happy to re-use them; this took well over 2 hours to sort out. The restaurant - an absolute embarrassment given the charges. The evening menu is seriously limited, they showed no understanding or concern when I pointed out that my wife as a diabetic had to be extremely careful with food; some of the waiters were absolutely incompetent. Ask for a milky coffee and they fill the cup with coffee to the brim, leaving no space for milk; when I asked them to bring me a piece of cake together with my coffee so that I could enjoy them together, that proved to be too difficult. I despair. I am used to 4-star Swiss hotels, so I expect high standards, but given how expensive the Crowne Plaza is this should not be a problem. I wouid never return to this hotel even if I were given free accommodation - it is absolutely shambolic, a complete rip-off.","July 7, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

61,"Top location and all staff are very professional and nice all the time. I am quite impressed by their service. I want to give them 5 star but I cannot due to that they charged double that comes $18k for 9 nights with two rooms. I found this strange charging issue while I stayed in Crowne Plaza Times Square, so I visited the counter to discuss about it and the gentleman spend several minutes to resolve the issue. He told me the charging issue has been resolved but actually it has not been resolved. Now, I get $18k charge on my credit card. WHY?I returned to my country and I found $18k is still there. So, what I am not happy is about the credit card payment issue that has killed my credit card usage due to double charge, $18k, and it has cause limit issue. Now I am unable to use credit card anymore due to limit issue even though I should have enough room to use credit card if Crowne Plaza Times Square did not charge twice. I received full payment on my card on both 2nd and 3rd July, and my check out was on 4th July. This must be caused by time difference between NZ and NYC. I need to pay some other important payments but unable to use my credit card anymore that made me very upset. I called Crowne Plaza as soon as I returned NZ but I was told I need to contact Billing department of Crowne Plaza Times Square; however, it was Friday night in NYC at the time due to time difference between New Zealand and NYC.

62,"I stayed here for one night after arriving from London, access from the airport (JFK) is fairly straightforward on public transport and with the traffic in NYC I chose the subway as a fairly painless way to get to the heart of NYC.The hotel is currently undergoing renovation and the access is off a side street which isn’t that easy to spot, I appreciate there were lots of billboards on the temporary hoardings around the building which would have been easily visible from across the street but if you are on the same side of the street they are almost impossible to spot and eye level sighs would have been helpful!Once I found the entrance although busy the hotel was very calm and relaxing, a welcome change to the streets outside! Checking in was fast and efficient and the staff were very welcoming. My room was on one of the highest floors in the building with limited views of the Hudson River and some of the city. Perfectly acceptable for my needs as after a long flight I just wanted to sleep! I would suggest requesting a room that isn’t next to the lifts though as the noise which is almost constant 24hr a day was somewhat annoying but not enough for me to complain and I slept to I guess not that bad! The room itself was very nice, large very comfortable bed, nice furniture and gear en suite bathroom, I have added an image below. The room was very clean and had plenty of space for what I believe was just a standard double room. Breakfast was served overlooking Times Square and was a very good buffet with superb service from very friendly staff. It was also very good value for money! If you want to be in central NYC then you won’t go far wrong with this hotel, I would certainly stay again if visiting New York.","July 6, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

64,We stayed for 4 nights in Crowne plaza and were a family of 8. Our check in experience was not too good even though the reception was quite and all receptionist were by themselves. They were not welcoming at all and didn’t really provide any information of the hotel or it’s facilities the staff’s attitude is very unpleasant. We booked a strip view room and when we checked in our room had views of building garages with literally no view at all I contacted reception and the manager on duty advised there is no other room than what we had and if we are to change rooms it wouldn’t make much difference hence we decided to stay in the given room.The rooms are really old and tiny.The gym is pretty big with lots of machines but again very old the only good we liked about staying here was the location and nothing else really is appealing and if anyone’s looking to stay in Times Square there’s much better options with better price options.,"July 3, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

67,"I’ve stayed at a number of Crowne Plazas over the years and I remember them almost always being a good experience. And while the location truly can’t be beat for wanting to be in Times Square, this one feels stuck in a time warp. While the lobby feels very dark and dreary in stark contrast to the bright lights and excitement of Times Square, the real fail was the room. Paint chipping around the windows; every piece of furniture gashed, chipped, scratched, and worn; bathtub glaze severely chipped (I felt like showering in my flip flops); tub took forever to drain and shower difficult to fully turn off; and the ceiling showed the scars of every piece of patchwork and repair that had been done over the years. Another minor, yet telling, sign of the age of this hotel is that the desk in the rooms do have power supply but not straight USB ports...a true sign the hotel is dated.Oh, and the elevator call light button on our floor was out so you were never really sure if the elevator was coming to get you when you pushed it.C’mon Crowne Plaza! This should be a showcase property for you and it’s sorry and depressing. Sink some money into the place and show some pride. I expect more from your brand.","July 1, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

68,"If you want to stay close to Times Square this is a pretty good choice. We reserved a King bed city view in mid-June 2019 and was given a corner room at the top floor (46th floor - Northeast corner). This corner room gives you nearly a wraparound view of the city. In other words, the windows wrap from the north side continuing to the east side of the room. This was pretty nice for staring out into the city from up high. Noise was about what you'd expect in the middle of Times Square. Even from the 46th floor you can hear sirens and car horns. If you're a light sleeper, might I suggest not staying in Times Square, maybe consider not even staying in Manhattan. It didn't bother us much at all, what was annoying was the bright blue Barclays building sign at night. Luckily the room has curtains to block out most of the outside lights. Other than that, for the most part everything was in order. The bathroom is a bit on the smaller side than I'm used to and the closet basically shares that space as well. Plenty of room for 2 people. For the price you pay a simple continental breakfast would've been nice. We did not get to try their restaurant/bar. (Why bother when you're in Times Square?) Elevators were pretty quick most of the time. Not much waiting or stops except for the mornings. Subways are 1-2 blocks away depending on the station. One small gripe, if any staff from the hotel reads this, might I suggest reversing the toilet paper holder. It's mounted in such a way that when you pull the toilet paper out the whole roll starts to come off the holder. If the holder were installed in reverse, that would solve the problem.","June 29, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

69,"This is a great hotel because of location and room quality is great for the price. There are a few things that very much annoyed me enough to write about it. So here is my story. I reserved my room on the 27th of this month and due to issues with my flight I got to this hotel around 2 or 3am the next morning. When I made it to the front desk to checkin I realized I forgot my wallet in the shuttle that dropped me off and ontop of that my phone was dead. The front desk agent was very nice and told me where I could charge my phone to call the shuttle service to get my wallet back. She saw that I was an IHG member and knew I had a reservation but I still needed my credit card and my ID. While waiting for the shuttle service to come back i wanted to let her know that i would have my wallet in 30 to 40 minutes and to thank her for her help. Unfortunately she was not there but her supervisor was. I decided to let him know about my situation since the woman u was speaking with earlier was gone. I was also going to see if a picture of my ID and credit card would be enough to get me in my room until the shuttle driver arrived with. Y wallet. While e playing my situtation to the Supervisor he got a very nasty attitude with me and very rudely cut me off while I was talking and told me to wait down stairs next to the bellman. Then he just ignored me and went about his business. I wanted to get his name but he had his name tag covered by a jacket. At that point I decided not to make a big deal out of his attitude and continued to wait for the shuttle driver. I had gotten. My wallet about 30 minutes later and went to checkin. The same Supervisor's attitude was very short and impolite. I felt like he thought I was below him or I did not deserve to stay at this resort. After he gave me my room key I proceeded to my assigned room and the keys did not work. I had to go back to the front desk which was over 30 floors down and get new keys. The same Supervisor was there and seemed shocked that the keys didn't work. So for some reason he told security to check the room and he also called the room to see if anyone was in there. That seemed strange to me because any other hotel or resort I have stayed in would just give me a new key. That is how i knew that he already knew something was wrong and was trying to hide it. After he called the room he said someone picked up and had to assign me a new room. He did not even apologize to me for the mistake. After I got the key to the new room I proceeded to it and when I got in there was cloths and bags all over the place (picture is attached to this post). I went back to the front desk which now was over 20 floors down. The same Supervisor was there again and i told him and showed him the picture I took and now he was shocked. He called out the person assigning the rooms to take care if it and offered me a free breakfast voucher. The person assigning the rooms came out and was very nice. He apologized to me and told me that the day was a little hectic and that he would take care of thg e problem. The Front Desk Supervisor seemed to catch an atti5with him as well eventhough he was doing his best to fix the problem. While the room assignment person was off making sure a room he found was clean and empty, the Front Desk Supervisor handed me 3 more breakfast vouchers and finally apologized to me. The room assignment person came back and told me every5was good now but the room type I had reserved was not available. I overlooked that and told him it was ok since I saw how hard he looked for a room for me. He then offered me dinner for the inconvenience and I accepted. AS I WAS WALKING AWAY THE FRONT DESK SUPERVISOR TOLD THE ROOM ASSIGNMENT PERON HE JUST GAVE ME BREAKFAST VOUCHERS AND WHY DID HE GIVE ME A COMPED DINNER? Very nasty and rudely to the room assignment person. I could also tell he had made a few more comments but could not hear everything because I was walking away. Bottomline, the Front Desk Supervisor working overnight from June 27th to the 28th had a very nasty attitude and made me feel uncomfortable about staying there. The room assignment person was awesome and had a fantastic attitude when under pressure and dealing with the negative attitude of the Front Desk Supervisor. The rest if the hotel staff was great.","June 29, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

71,"Stayed in this hotel for five days and four nights during a recent trip to New York. The best thing about this hotel is the location - it's right at the heart of Times Square where all the action is.The room was clean, modern, and actually spacious by New York standards. There were plenty of sockets and USB ports for us to plug in our devices, and WiFi was pretty good. Our rooms were cleaned daily and toiletries were regularly restocked. However, the room did not have a minibar or even a refrigerator, which is odd for a hotel at this price range. The hotel's facade along Broadway was being renovated, so there was a bit of a confusion locating the hotel entrance when we first arrived. Although there was a sign directing people where to go, it was too small to easily notice. Also, given the hotel's location and popularity among large groups (like student tour groups and large families), the elevators can get a bit busy at times.Overall, this is a very good hotel and highly recommended!","June 27, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

92,"Stay Report - 5/31 - 6/2Location: Seemingly every hotel between 33rd and 51st, 10th Avenue to 6th Avenue claims to be ""Times Square"" so that's a meaningless term.  Specifically, this hotel is located on Broadway between 48th and 49th (the hotel takes up the whole block and has entrances on both 48th and 49th).  48th Street has an entrance to the 49th Street N/R/W Station, 49th has an entrance to the 50th Street 1 Station and a block away on 8th Avenue is the 50th Street C/E Station.  There are a number of theaters nearby and plenty of restaurants and the like.  LGA is about a $40 Uber away in no trafficHotel: The hotel itself is a massive high rise.  I was happy to find they have separated the elevator banks into serving the lower half and upper half of floors which means shorter waits than at other high rises.  The lobby is one floor up from the entrance and has a large restaurant which does a buffet breakfast, a coffee shop and a bar as well as a lot of meeting space another floor up.Check In: As a Spire Elite I was given a coupon for the buffet breakfast for just $16 instead of $40.  Room: Much, much larger than many Manhattan rooms I've stayed in.  While it was nothing all that special, having the space for me and my travel companion was really nice. The bathroom was also big enough and the shower got really, REALLY hot if you wanted it to.  Wifi worked well as well.I was just here for a Points and Cash Accelerate rate but I found myself pleasantly surprised.  I'd be happy to return. ","June 4, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

Rahi at the bar area was the nicest person in the hotel, I had a cold and he recommended an Indian tea ""Bombay Chai"" which helped me to recover. The best service ever!

99,"The corner rooms are nice the others are pretty average on par with most 4 star hotels. The bedding is very comfortable but the windows are not soundproof so you do get some street noise (I was on the 16th floor). Just FYI the king rooms only have showers (no tub) so if that is important be sure to reserve a room with two doubles. The lobby area is small in comparison to other large resort hotels in the area. It is mostly made up of a bar area. There is a nice coffee/snack counter on the same level, with amazing pastries and lunch items. The real selling point to this hotel is it's smack in the the middle of time square location. Fantastic if you plan on taking in some broadway shows. It is also a easy walk to Rockefeller center (NBC, Top of the rock, Radio City etc.)","May 27, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

101,"We booked this hotel via a package with BA Holidays and so resort fees etc were all included in the price. We chose this hotel because of its location and we were able to book a room overlooking TS. On our previous visits we have stayed just off 8th Avenue and TS but this was definitely a great choice, especially since I have mobility problems this hotel is right in the centre which for me was ideal and the room overlooking TS allows me to rest and at the same time have a view. We ate in the lounge a few times and the food was excellent although not a big menu the food on it satisfied both of us as vegetarians and our son who is a meat eater. This a busy hotel but we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a lift. There is also a coffee shop selling good coffee and fresh bakery items, cheese plates, and hot breakfast sandwiches only 1 day was there a bit queue but they put extra staff on and we were quickly served - the corn muffins and almond croissants are delicious.

102,"Beware of the additional hidden fee, the resort fee $40/night. When you search this hotel it will show you a lower price, then at the very bottom small section you will see that the resort fee is $40/night. For us, who are staying 11 nights at this hotel. This is totally ridiculous. However, the managers are helpful. The manager is very helpful and great in providing solutions. The front desk is also a nice lady who is also very helpful in accommodating my needs. They also have a customer service to handle your matter quickly by phone. Basically, they have a great team here. If you want to use the pool a shower cap is needed, they don't sell it. but at the shop downstairs they sell it for $10. It is unfortunate that the hotel still practicing the hidden resort fee $40 charges/night. They have hidden charges for other things too. $7 for accepting a mail. $5 for using the computer for 5 minutes. It makes the hotels looks sneaky and tricky. Thus, I would not come back here again.","May 24, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

However it’s worth noting that the bed was quite high and might not suit everyone.The room included a coffee machine, iron & ironing board and great blackout curtains (especially good given the light from Times Square). The room was well insulated from noise too.Although on the smaller size the bathroom had all that we needed but no bath but we didn’t want one.The only things the room could have benefited from was a long mirror for dressing in the bedroom / hallway and additional charging points.We would definitely stay at the Crowne Plaza again and can recommend it.","May 20, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

105,"We travelled to NYC to celebrate a friend's special birthday so a central location with a brand name was selected, the Crowne Plaza Times Square.Upon arrival the check in was swift and efficient and my credit card taken as a guarantee with a holding amount that would be released at the time we checked out.The room we had wasn't overlooking Times Square which we were happy about as when we went to our friend's room (that did overlook the square) the outside noise was apparent. I don't think you'll need to worry too much about noise keeping you awake (unless you're a REALLY light sleeper) as I didn't struggle at all - the alarm woke me every morning!The room was as expected of a Crowne Plaza; decent size, large king size bed, clean bathroom, TV, in-room safe, coffee maker, hangers in the wardrobe, iron with ironing board and bathroom amenities. There wasn't anything wrong with the room however I wasn't wowed either. I think this is because it's older decor; warmer browns/creams in colour rather than the fashionable silver/greys. I would say that the hotel could benefit from some TLC throughout as rooms and public areas are beginning to show signs of wear and tear.The location is what sells this hotel - literally step outside the hotel and you're in the centre of Times Square, overlooking the M & M's store. The front entrance is currently undergoing refurbishment so all access is via the rear doors where the cars/taxis drop off customers.When we checked out the bill showed the resort fee as $5 more than we were expecting. I pointed this out to the reception staff who rectified the bill. Our friends were also incorrectly charged and hadn't noticed the difference until we mentioned it.The only source of disappointment was the amount of time it took for the funds to be released back to my card - almost 2 weeks. This I find unreasonable as well as unexpected.All in all I would recommend this hotel however you'll pay a premium due to it's location.","May 16, 2019","1    Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan

108,"This was our 2nd time at this hotel. First off, it is the perfect location to be able to walk to Broadway Shows. We also walked to the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, and Times Square is very close. There are so many restaurants and it is just a very easy location to get around. Subway stops are very convenient as well.The room was clean, though nothing special. The sink space in the bathroom is small as are the regular rooms, but that seems the case in NYC.We did have two minor issues, both resolved well by the hotel. One night we had put out our order to have breakfast served in our room, and we had it out by 9 p.m. and they say you have until 2 a.m. But, when our food did not arrive on time, we called and they had not picked up our order......and we had a time constraint....fortunately the manager allowed us to grab some food quickly in the breakfast buffet area without charge. The second problem was we had many items billed to us from the minibar. However, we never use the minibar and had not taken out any items. They somehow showed that we had used them, but did not charge us. While I don't understand the system because we did NOT use or take any of the items, I appreciated the removal of these things from our bill.We will definitely go back to this hotel and strongly encourage others to stay here!","July 12, 2019","2    InterContinental New York Times Square

111,"I have stayed at this hotel many times before and loved it. I even wrote a review a few years ago. I was traveling with 2 teenagers and we checked into the room around 8:00pm. I was tired so went to sleep and woke up in the morning to find they only gave us 1 bottle of shampoo and 1 bottle of conditioner. This I cannot understand. You have 3 people in a room why would you only give 1 bottle. The next day after they cleaned the room they only left towels for 2. I stopped at the main desk and asked for more and they sent someone up right away. I should not have to ask for this. I had booked a package that included breakfast. The first morning we went to the restaurant and it was very crowded waited about 15 mins for a table. Went to the buffet and much of the food was empty and all the fruit was gone. When returned to my table I flagged down a waiter to get coffee, that was the only time I saw him. We did make a second trip to the buffet and when we returned to the table they never cleared any plates. I never got a second cup of coffee. When I received the bill it stated parties of 5 or more 18% tip is automatically added. I was about to leave a 10% tip which I thought was generous for the level of service and I noticed they already added an 18% tip and I had no way to reverse it. Needless to say we did not go there for breakfast the next day. The location of the hotel is great, the rooms are spacious but the service this weekend was not good. I love this hotel so I hope they do something about the service level or I will be looking for a new go to hotel in NYC. ","July 8, 2019","2    InterContinental New York Times Square

112,"We had a layover and spent the night at IC Time Square. We had a king sky corner room. The hotel itself wasn't bad, but it was definitely not up to typical Intercontinental standard. Location: It's a block from Time Square, which obviously is super touristic area. It's convenient if you plan to catch a broadway show. But other than that it's not really a location to experience New York, and most locals avoid that area. For catching show: 5/5, for everything else 3/5.Room: Our Sky corner room was definitely very small, it's no where near the 325 square feet that it advertised as. More like under 200 sq ft. The view wasn't bad, but also nothing to brag about. The hall way and the room actually has a Holiday Inn feel rather than an Intercontinental Hotel feel. There's really nothing luxurious about the hotel. And the hotel provided only one robe and one slipper despite its a room for two and our reservation clear stated two people. Overall room is what expect from Holiday Inn, 3/5.Amenities: There's the lobby bar. I didn't use the fitness center. But there are fairly limited amenities offered. 3/5Service: Not terrible, but not warm either. Nothing Intercontinental about the service. Just mediocre. 3/5Overall it was a very average hotel. It's not awful, but it not great either. And the sky corner view room was definitely under whelming. There are many good hotels in NYC, I don't think this is one I would return.","July 7, 2019","2    InterContinental New York Times Square

116,"This hotel was perfect. The beds were amazingly comfortable ( I prefer and have a memory foam mattress at home and this was just as comfortable as home). The only complaint I have is that the air conditioner had an issue and the Internet was spotty. Overnight, me and my traveling companions, like the room kept very cool. With the AC set on 69 degrees Fahrenheit, the room temp would creep upwards. One night I was so warm I went and checked it to make sure it was set properly. It was - AC on set at 69 degrees. However the room temp was 74 degrees and the fan was not running! I decreased the temp setting to 67 to get the fan to kick back on and went back to bed. In the morning the room was freezing (which I didn't mind). The internet (free WiFi) was spotty and had connection issues some of the time, but there was a HUGE event going on in town that weekend as to possibly have overrun the system. So, be that as it may, everything else was so far above par that I couldn't even be upset. Especially we LOVED the restaurant and bar area. Nick was our waiter and he was FANTASTIC!

130,"We wanted to be in the theater district and the Intercontinental was well located. Our king room was 350 sqft which was nice and larger than many hotel rooms in Mid-Town New York. We were on the 36th floor and and it was very quiet. From the front desk, to the maids to the bell men, the service was wonderful and delivered with a cheery disposition. Service to the room was quick and efficient. Cleanliness excellent. Comfortable bed. Like in most hotels in New York, the prices for the mini-bar, daily service fee, room service and all the amenities are high. I had a pair of pants dry cleaned for a business meeting at a tab $35 although it was on a weekend to be fair. We would go back to the InterContinental and recommend it to others.We were there on a business and theater trip combined.","June 25, 2019","2    InterContinental New York Times Square

It has a nicely equipped gym with dumb-bells, a few weight machines, plus cardio equipment. The only complaint I have which is insignificant, was the card reader in the elevators was difficult to work and the breakfast buffet is very expensive.

137,"I always thought the Intercontinental was an upmarket luxury experience. Sadly this is the worst experience I’ve had this year with a hotel chain. The list of woes:- No rooms avail at checkin early is fine, but forgetting to call me when the room is ready isn’t cool. - if you breathe on an item in the mini bar such as a small Fiji water they charge you. By the way that small Fiji is $10.45 which is about $2 per sip. - there is no lobby to speak of as the only place to sit is there restaurant/drinks area. If you happen to bring a bagel for you daughter to eat then they’ll shoo you out. - phone calls are $10 per minute. Don’t use the in room phone. - bathtub doesn’t drain - full of hair. - the view of the backyard mold garden is pretty epic. The front deck did remove all the breathing charges and phone calls, but an indelible impression of unwantedness pervades this shocking bad nyc hotel.

The service bell guys outside were much more cheerful and friendly as compared to the staffs inside the hotel! Check-in and out were swift.

The only negative I experienced was that my room rate included an amenities fee of $30 per day which afforded a $20 credit. We used the credit at breakfast and inadvertently ran up an $80 breakfast bill. A buffet was the only option but if you take certain items it upcharges significantly from continental to full breakfast charge. Be sure to read the menu carefully and ask questions. Also, not all rates seem to include this amenities fee. So check it it out as you compare rates and choices. ","June 11, 2019","2    InterContinental New York Times Square

155,"Although the rooms are very comfortable, one cannot help but get the impression that the hotel is nothing more than a building with comfortable rooms in the middle of Times Square and an absolute lack of hospitality. And I’m calling out the reception staff who always seem to be either bored of their jobs or beyond the customer... I mean honestly the porters are doing a much much better job than you guys. No ‘can do’ attitude that one expects from a hotel at this price point and supposed reputation. But what was really surprising to me was how an international hotel chain such as intercontinental does not cater what so ever to people like myself who have food intolerances. Come on management, it’s 2019.. the buffet breakfast is reminiscent of a three star hotel from the 1980’s. Options are very limited to say the least. No alternatives to dairy. No gluten free options. No vegan options other than fruits. No variation from day to day. But what really ticked me off is the unsanitary situation where they have a small fridge with smoked salmon, hard boiled eggs and chicken/beef cold-cuts and butter all together in the same place with only one serving spoon for everything. Pretty gross. The fridge had lots of fallen bits and pieces from the days before. More care can be taken in terms of hygiene in that area.

162,"We picked this property because we were using Marriott points AND because it was one of the few hotels that has two queen beds in a room. We couldn't reserve the two queens when making the reservation, but we called 24 hours before we arrived and they were able to secure us a room with 2 Queens and a beautiful view of the Empire States Building and on the 15th floor which was quiet. I've stayed in NYC before, and this room was so much quieter than a room that was much more expensive. We were pleased with our room. The bathroom was very small but the shower was very good size. I appreciated how clean the bathroom was and didn't show signs of wear. Housekeeping did a pretty good job. We had one day where the room was cleaned, she took all the towels and didn't replace them. No big deal. I didn't care for the frosted glass bathroom door. But we made it work with wrapping paper to cover it. Location was great! We found the 34th Street/Herald Sq subway to be the closest. But overall it was a very central location. We felt very safe walking at all hours. We were surprised though that security wasn't too tight. I expected a doorman or even that we'd have to use our key in the evening hours to go up the elevator to our room. Not sure what keeps people off the street from coming in. At least we didn't have any issues. Also, elevators were fast and never a problem. Breakfast was fine. We've stayed at many other Marriott properties that have signs that say if you're gluten free they have other cereal or bread options, just ask.

My real problem is with some of the basics they do not offer like umbrellas (important in the Spring), just tiny ones to buy, and water in the lobby. I can’t remember a hotel that hasn’t offered free water bottles or a bubbler of some sort in the lobby. Nothing. And there’s really no lobby to speak of, a few seats and end tables, no New York feel, nowhere to lounge and gather. Probably because most of the lobby is taken up with the breakfast space. I did appreciate the free WiFi. Key issues, they didn’t have any when we arrived, had to wait several hours. Plumbing not great.

169,"I believe that this hotel was a good value for our money. I’d done my homework so I had an idea what to expect. I know the rooms would be on the smaller side and the bathroom would be small (they were) and that the bathroom might be not far from the end of the bed and might have a frosted glass door (it did). For me, traveling with a 16-year-old son, having a breakfast included was a requirement. While not a ton of variety, we found the breakfast adequate for our needs. All items were fully stocked and the area was kept clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. One day I went down to get breakfast to take back up. I asked if they had trays for this purpose. I was told no but that there was a tray in the room I could use. I decide to try and take food up anyway. While gathering food, the staff brought me a makeshift cardboard box tray to use and even gave me tips on how to best fit my items. The location was great as we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The only downside was one morning one of the elevators was down. The elevator was working again by that afternoon. Since there were just two of us, this hotel worked well for us. If I were bringing the whole family, I’d upgrade to a nearby hotel that had larger rooms.","April 1, 2019","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

174,"I checked in and it was really pleasant. My room was freezing, so I called down for some blankets. After about a half hour, I got one, but it was not very thick, so I called down for another one, and they brought me a comforter and another blanket. Finally I was warm, so I called down to thank them, and the person at the front desk said it was a one minute fix in terms of resetting the air con unit. So they fixed that. Loved the cleaning lady this am who offered to do my room while I was at the gym. Then i get back from work, and there was no shampoo in my room. No one answered the phones, so I went down and met a VERY RUDE AND AGGRESSIVE man in the ""off room"" not the front desk who said they were very busy and he would have to radio my request. I don't care if you are having a bad day, you don't act like that. The front entrance is out of commission and one elevator doesn't work. Probably for maintenance. I stay here a LOT for work travel and this is the first time so many things have gone pear shaped. To the extent that someone just randomly said to me ""nothing seems to work in this hotel"".

Breakfast was yummy! Be sure to go early to breakfast because the dining area gets crowded. As others have stated, the elevators were slow, not really a problem. The staff we encountered including front desk, maintenance, and housekeeping were all very friendly and polite! Big plus! Nice seating outside but it was too cold for us to enjoy.

Frosted door meant anytime someone went to use the bathroom at night the entire room would light up. Tub did not drain well, rough towels (only 3 provided). Only shampoo and conditioner supplies (no body wash or cream). The worst part about this hotel is the elevators. One wasn’t working during my stay so my choices were walk up several flights of stairs or wait 20 min. This is not acceptable. Breakfast was good. Lots of choices.

We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel as there is so much to see in the city.

Also, the subway station at Harold Square (2 blocks) allows easy access to the B/D/F/M and N/Q/R/W lines. Penn Stations is about 4 blocks away.The hotel is a relatively new property – rooms are small but efficient with a separate desk area. Rooms include a small refrigerator and microwave.Breakfast is included and includes eggs and a protein (seems to alternate between sausage and bacon) and includes various juices and breads.The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful – maid was wonderful and always checked to see if we needed anything.Will definitely stay again next year.","December 21, 2018","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

187,"We just stayed 1 night this past Saturday for a Christmas visit. Cannot beat the location since it's short walk to Macy's (to see Santa), Time Sq, and Bryant Park. Being right on 5th Ave, we took subway up to Central Park and walked our way back down, checking out all the window displays and decorations. One can get here easily from all airports via Train (from Newark) or Subway (from JFK or LGA) for cheap. I took 3 nieces with me and the free breakfast definitely saved time, money and headache in the morning. We were in Room 1605 and the view of Empire State Building was smack in front of us!Front desk staffs were nice even when swamped with people. We were able to store our bags since rooms weren't available for early check in.Room size is above average for a big city hotel. There is a mini fridge and a microwave which is great for leftovers. One thing I like to point out, and I know it sounds a little silly: the bathroom door is a barn style slide door with a frosted glass in the middle. You wouldn't think much of it until you have 3 kids who giggled and laughed because if you look hard enough, you can see the silhouette of the person inside the bathroom. Meaning if you are traveling with someone you don't know well, or if you really like total privacy while using bathroom and you are sharing room, considered yourself warned. We ended up buying Christmas wrapping paper and taped it over the door since one of the girls were having anxiety knowing others can ""see"" her using the toilet. As a Category 5 hotel, it's 35K points to redeem for a night. Or in my case I used my annual free night from Marriott credit card for this stay. Definitely worth the free night since room was going for over $300 a night during this time of the year.Great stay. In fact I think I stayed here before with my mom. Definitely will stay here again!","December 17, 2018","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

190,"Pretty good for the price, no major complaints but nothing was great either. Location is convenient; The hotel is new and clean; rooms are tight but have a work area/desk, small fridge and microwave. I’ve stayed at two other SpringHills, however, in California and this one was so cramped that calling it “all-suite” is simply a misnomer. It’s an averaged sized room for nyc at best.Why 4 stars? The downstairs main area also feels tight and cramped. There are lots of boxes behind the check-in station, and the walkways and tv watching area feel like they are shoehorned in.Staff was fine - but there didn’t appear to be anything extra provided to Marriott platinum guests - and they didn’t seem particularly cheerful and welcoming like many Courtyards by Marriott (who always seem to have exceptionally good people for some reason)Breakfast is average for a courtyard/Spring Hill type hotel, although they did have scrambled eggs and bacon or sausage every morning. All in all, it’s fine and you’ll be fine staying here. The main reason to do so is price : Renaissance Midtown, Marriott Marquis are better if price is close. I do like it better than Residence Inn Midtown which needs renovation. Next time I am going to look at Marriott Vacation Club Pulse next door as well.","November 9, 2018","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

193,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel while attending the New York City Wine and Food Tasting Festival the weekend of October 13 and 14, 2018. This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel for this event. We arrived at the hotel shortly after noon, and we were greeted by the very polite front desk staff. We were assigned Room 1901, an Executive Suite facing the Empire State Building. This is the same room we stayed in on our last visit. My wife and I had no problems sleeping that night, as the bed was very comfortable and the noise level was non existent. The hotel is not located on a busy thoroughfare, so this contributes to the low noise level. The location of the hotel is ideal, as it is within easy walking distance of New York's main attractions. For example, Rockefeller Center and Saint Patrick's Cathedral are a 15 minutes walk from the hotel. Times Square is a 10 minutes walk, and Herald Square is only a 5 minute walk. A free breakfast is included in the lobby area, and there is an ample amount of food to pick from. Our only complaint is the basic internet speed, which is very slow. Therefore, it is recommended visitors upgrade to the high speed internet, which is free for Marriott Rewards members. The hotel allowed us to store our luggage free of charge after we checked out, so we attend the Wine and Food Festival.

The modern updated room is very small and compact and there isn't much room to move in the bathroom with little counter space.

202,"Pros1. Breakfast is ""free"" or complimentary2. Clean room3. Bed is comfortable 4. Gym is clean and equipment is in good conditionCons1. Bathroom is so tiny I dont even know where to put my toiletries. It's essentially a half bath with a shower. 2. Elevators take forever! There are only 2 to service the building. You're better off taking the stairs....you'll wait for a good 5 to 10 minutes during high peak elevator times.3. Breakfast options are ok. Not much variety for a healthy eater.4. What I didnt like is they purposely dont give you body lotion when they clean your room...CHEAP! You have to request it. Never been to a marriott that actively tries to save and cut corners like this. Makes me wonder what else they are cutting on...Anyways I wouldnt stay here again their are better options.","August 20, 2018","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

204,"I was tricked by the word Suites in the name. These were not Suites. These were tiny rooms with small double beds. No place for luggage, no drawers and ate your bathroom. They say it’s a room for four but we were two normals sized people and it was tight. Our air conditioning never worked despite multiple attempts to fix it and it was uncomfortably hot in the room (the hotel was booked, no other rooms available), and the air conditioning leaked water so the rug was wet. We did get small compensation for the problem, Marriott Points, but it didn’t make up for the hot, sleepless nights. The included Breakfast was always too crowded to get a table or to even get to the food so we gave up and ate down the street. The staff was always very nice and helpful, especially the electrician who worked on the air conditioning. And we had a spectacular view of the Empire State Building. I don’t think I’d stay here again or recommend it to friends.","August 10, 2018","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

205,My son and I stayed here first week of August. Location is great with a 5 minute walk to the 34th St-Herald Square subway station where you can easily get to anywhere in the city. Our room was clean and surprisingly quiet but small but that is expected in NYC. We stayed in room 1509 and had a view of the Empire State Building which was awesome! Breakfast is included but is only served until 9am. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Manhattan but at a reasonable rate with a convenient location.

207,"We booked and paid ( in full and in advance) for 5 nights at this hotel in mid June (via Expedia). We received an email confirmation the day before that arrival at around 8pm was fine. On arrival ( from Cancun ) were were told the hotel was overbooked and could not accommodate us. No explanation and no sympathy . We were directed to a phone to contact Expedia to arrange alternative accommodation. Expedia blamed the hotel and the hotel Expedia. After more than 3 hours standing at the front desk talking to the Expedia call centre in Asia we finally got a booking ( at Expedia's expense ) at the Hilton Times Square. Fortunately, the front desk staff there were extremely helpful ( it took another hour on the phone to Expedia to confirm arrangements ) and their professional attitude was a complete contrast to the indifference shown by the Spring hill suites staff. Overbooking seems to be a problem in Manhattan mid week as there were 2 other guests in the queue at the Hilton who suffered the same fate. So no idea what the rooms are like at this hotel as, despite paying in advance and receiving written confirmation, we were not allowed to stay.","July 26, 2018","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

208,"This is the second time visited this hotel in the past 10 months and this visit was even better than the first. Comfy, clean rooms and friendly staff. There isn't a thing I can complain about when it comes to this hotel. A lot of people complain about the size and say the rooms aren't suites, however it is NYC. The rooms are a decent size (my husband and I got the king suite). We did lots of shopping and since there is only a small amoir you have to be creative about how you use the storage space. Other than that space is definitely not at issue. We stayed in late May and at the time the roads were being paved and despite the fact that heavy machinery was being used late night/early morning we didn't hear a thing. Also front desk was able to arrange a great car service for us to get back to JFK if taxis aren't your thing be sure to ask about the hotel's preferred car service as they make the reservations and everything.","July 22, 2018","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

211,"They do not waste square footage in Manhattan! This hotel was a great location for us - easy to get to Grand Central Station, close to a couple of other subway stops and bus lines. Some good restaurants close by - a Chick-Fil-A right on our corner. We took advantage of their parking option and paid to have our van parked off site for the four nights we stayed. Our room was compact but had plenty of space for our family - two queen size beds, a night stand between them and then a large desk area with a small wardrobe/ closet in the corner. Wifi worked fine even with all four of us on our own devices. I prefer bathroom sinks that have a counter, but this did have a small shelf next to it that worked for toothbrushes and toothpaste. The bathroom had plenty of space but the shower had no edge and so the floor in front of the toilet was often wet for a few hours after the shower was used. The room was clean and housekeeping did a great job for us each day. The corridors are tight, barely wide enough to maneuver a luggage cart, but it worked. We were happy we were on the third floor because that made use of the stairs very practical for us as we came in and out. Breakfast was fine - pretty much what we expected for a complimentary buffet. There was congestion in the seating area during breakfast, long lines and people sitting on anything flat. We were able to take advantage of the small patio space and escape to eat outside.","June 24, 2018","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

214,"As always this is an account of my personal experience with this hotel and may not reflect every traveller's experience.We arrived at JFK in good time from Manchester after a problem free flight with Virgin Altantic. The queues at immigration are long and slow moving so be prepared for a long wait especially (as in our case) another large airliner arrives at the same time. Pleasingly once through customs our bags were waiting and finding a taxi (prices fixed to Manhattan) was simple and well organised.The hotel is approximately 40mins from JFK by taxi and is superbly located in the Midtown district. Reception was efficient, business like and swift. The hotel seems modern and well maintained throughout. Our room was to the back of the hotel overlooking what is soon to be another hotel! We could see the Empire State Building reflected in the glass of adjacent buildings. Some rooms to the front do look out to the building itself. Our room was a good size and was equipped with a fridge, microwave, nicely appointed shower room and a comfortable bed. There was a TV, desk, phones and all the usual necessities (iron, hairdryer, storage etc) and coffee making facilities.If your room doesnt look out over the ESB take a trip up to the top floor and although you cant access the roof terracing you get a great view through the locked glass access doors!!Breakfast is typically American with a wide selection of pastries and cereals as well as bacon and eggs. There is also a choice of fruit, yoghurts and juices. The meal is served in the smallish dining area next to reception and although there are plenty of seats it does become a little busy at times. Don't let this put you off though - the food is tasty and plentiful and you just need to judge your timings to ensure a comfortable meal!The hotel is great for exploring being in range of Times Square, ESB, Grand Central Station and other highlights of city. Next door is the Top of the Strand rooftop bar which has excellent views directly onto the ESB. Locally there are shops, bars and restaurants (all within 5mins walk). Cabs regularly pass the entrance for those who need them. Staff at the hotel are friendly and welcoming and typically keen to ensure that the customers experience is positive. They will look after your baggage should you have a later flight post-check out.There is a basement gym on site.For the price and location this hotel is great and thoroughly recommended for the tourist traveller especially couples.","June 2, 2018","3    SpringHill Suites New York Midtown Manhattan/F...

Staying in a room that doesn't even have a coffee maker or fridge, not for me, you cant even get a free cup of coffee downstairs...And the fact that you couldn't sit on the terrace without making a purchase squashed my desire to sit out there. It is not that I can't afford to pay for a drink, it's just that if I am a paid guest of the hotelI shouldn't be required to buy anything to sit on the terrace.

Like Taco Bell napkins. Unless a staff member dropped the napkins and made them into the bed, I don't think the fitted sheet was changed before we slept there.

228,"We chose this location because Mr. Leslie Jordan was performing in the Green Room 42 located within the hotel (excellent show!!) and we went to NYC specifically to see his show. Parking is below the hotel. Our room was Premium Queen View on the 20th floor. Kiosk check-in did not work but we had friendly check-in on the 4th floor at 2:30 pm with no problems. The room was very clean! It is small but very efficient. The bed is similar to a hospital bed in that the head portion elevates. As the head comes up, the bed slides up allowing for more leg room in the room. When you lay the head down (electric button) the bed slides into the room. The shower is small and efficient with body/face wash, shampoo and conditioner bottles on the wall. Water flow is acceptable but it is a gentle rain shower head (no hand wand) and less forceful than I prefer. Temperature was easy to adjust and responsive.The location is excellent! It is right in the theater district and an easy walk to Time's Square but not on one of the busy, noisy main roads. If you are coming to NY for a short stay and just want a clean, safe place to sleep this is it. There is also safe luggage storage with a cool robot doing the work but we did not use it this time.Except for the ice maker not working on our floor (or any floor we checked) we had no significant issues.

No email reply at all for the issue. Besides the facility fee per day, you also need to expect to pay US$1 for each cup of warm water from their machine, no water kettle available in YOTEL at all. Moreover, for better time management please use manual instead of their robotic luggage storage; by staff it took 2-3 minutes merely to take care of your luggage, by the robot on the Ground Floor it took at least 5-6 minutes for storing and retrieving your luggage. We tried both. And the main room lights are purple-ish no matter how you adjust the setting, so be prepare that the visibility wasn't as good as in the bathroom (at least there's brighter lighting near the toilet's mirror). For accessibility, if you are coming from Broadway direction, remember to choose 42nd Street (instead of 40th or 41st Street, they are either dead end with pedestrian roads suddenly disappear or less walkable), we tried them all.

240,"Let me start off by saying I plan trips months in advance, with that said maybe you can see where I'm coming from (unlike the manager on duty-Tomo). I reserved ONE NIGHT at Yotel back in February (through Expedia) and then in March I BOOKED AND PAID FOR ONE NIGHT (through my work discount site). I completely forgot that I had reserved through Expedia (I admitted my mistake) but we DID STAY there! Before we left NYC, I checked my CC online and noticed a $300 charge and I was confused to say the least, so since we were still close by, we walked back over there and the front desk lady was not helpful (told me to call Expedia and deal with them- which I did and Expedia told me to talk to Yotel!) I went back to the desk and asked for the manager and he was EXTREMELY UNSYMPATHETIC to my honest mistake but after awhile (I'm sure just to get me to leave) he asked if a 50% refund was ok, I said ""fine"" but come to find out that 50% doesn't actually mean 50% of the TOTAL bill, it only meant the room fee! So I double payed for the security deposit AND I paid double in taxes for ONE NIGHT! Tomo's demeanor and lack of caring completely rubbed me the wrong way and I promise, I WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!

The place advertised itself as a “State of the art hotel rooms” which was a bit of a concern, but hey given our timelines how bad could it be, right? Well, how about a few examples: - 3 pairs of key cards, multiple trips up and down to help desk to get those key cards, at the end help from the person (who wasn’t convinced at first that we can hold a key card to a door and not that the card given to us are useless) from front desk goes got us into the room. - 3 nights out of 6 night we were there, the air conditioner wasn’t working in the room. After second night we were convinced it wasn’t us and asked it to be fixed. Took multiple reminders to the stuff at help desk before situation got resolved- Only 1 day out of 7 days we were there, the full set of towels was present in the room. After second day, had a betting game going on which ones would be missing next dayOverall it seems folks invested whole a lot into gadgets and technology, but not enough into their stuff and comfort of its gets.

The hotel itself is clean and in a great location. Unfortunately when we returned from a night out our friends, they discovered the next morning they were missing a very expensive work laptop/Nintendo and other electronic accessories. The worst thing about being robbed on vacation is not only is your stuff gone but you also lose a whole day of vacation dealing with security, police and the hotel. Then on top of that the hotel management could care less, they did nothing to accommodate my friend or ever take any responsibility in the situation. I mean not even a room comp, free meal while you deal with police or even a simple cup of coffee...so sad! They also do not keep cameras in the hallways like most hotels, have a very tiny safe that doesn't fit much and you really have to slam the door to the room for it to lock...The police also told my friend this happened two weeks ago and then they were back the next day as another room had been robbed as well.

My room was about the size of a walk in closet. That being said, it was so strategically designed that I really didn't need more room. Certainly not for everyone. I was surprised to find the bed had only a bottom sheet on it and a top sheet FOLDED up at the bottom of it. Not sure what that is about?? Glad room had excellent temperature control cause there was no blanket. But really, they don't make the bed?  Location is excellent! I was able to walk to theater and to Penn Station.  The accommodations fee of $40 seemed steep but i knew about it ahead of time so no surprise there. Checked out at 7:30 AM and fortunately went over final bill. I was charged $50 for a ""late check out."" The sun was barely up. Anyway, went to FOUR (command central) and was told it would be taken off my bill. Again, up and down. Took it off bill but it seemed like they were doing me a favor. I actually stood there thanking the person rather than accepting an apology. (it was early....I hadn't had coffee).  Anyway, it was a unique experience. Hotel was spotlessly clean and I was only in it for sleeping. So it was fine. If you are someone who likes to lounge around your room, this isn't for you.

Location in East midtown is great, with subway access nearby, and many choices of restaurants around the corner on 2nd Avenue. It is definitely “bare bones “ but with all necessities covered. Clean and comfortable with an accommodating staff - knowledgeable, friendly concierge on duty as well. Some really low priced rooms have shared baths so be aware of that when booking, (We had a small sink in the sleeping area abutting a tiny bathroom with toilet and shower stall.). Plenty of closet space, a couple of chairs at a desk, good lighting options. Clean and comfortable throughout, Nice rooftop space was a plus. The hotel offers free three hour walking tours of city neighborhoods which we would love to have taken advantage of, given more time.

279,"Google asks me ""why was it poor"" in reference to my experience at pod51. Where do I start. Let's start from the beginning. The attitude of the front desk did not respect us as humans being but as objects they can milk money from. No greeting or professionalism whatsoever. When we got to the room, we found out that it does not have any bathroom in it. Something that was rather a surprise since in all my years of hotels in the United states I have never experienced that before. However and regardless this was not at all represented in the pictures of the room. But okay. With that we can live. What we couldn't live with was the LACK OF HANDICAPPED ACCESS inside those pitiful so called bathrooms at pod51. My mother suffers from severe RA and is handicapped and could not squat down to the low level of the toilet nor could even take a shower due to lack of handicapped railing in the shower. The room was dirty and smelled like mold. The bathroom had rust everywhere, holes in the walls and even roaches. Pictures attached. This was like a stay in a horror show. We had to abandon this hotel as soon as the morning sun came up. This was a disaster. Save your money and do not stay here. Scary.","June 5, 2019","5    Pod 51 Hotel

283,"We picked this hotel for the location and we were not disappointed. We were within walking distance of central park, empire state building, times square etc. The room was clean and well presented. Yes it was smaller than most hotel rooms, we picked a room with privet bathroom and I would say the bathroom offered no privacy, as you shut the frosted door you could see a clear window into the bathroom from the bed which made us laugh. There was a good heating system, good wifi and basic facilities which was all we needed. Just a side note, the corridor outside our room was quite noisy throughout the night so we never got a great night sleep.","May 23, 2019","5    Pod 51 Hotel

285,"To be honest, I was a little apprehensive about my stay at Pod51, but I was very pleasantly surprised. You can't beat the price for Manhattan, and the hotel was well-appointed and comfortable for being such an economical choice. The rooms are small, but they have all that you need and are fine for a solo traveler. I opted for a private bathroom/twin bed option and the room was clean and comfortable. The roof deck has great views and good seating, and the lobby bar/cafe is cozy as well. Plus, the hotel offered free wine and a top-floor room with great view as a perk for booking direct. Overall, I can heartily recommend this hotel to an efficient and low-key traveler who is OK with missing out on some nicer amenities and space in exchange for a low rate.","May 14, 2019","5    Pod 51 Hotel

286,"I stayed at Pod 51 with my boyfriend over New Year's, and we had a great experience. It's a bit like a hotel-hostel hybrid, with some rooms sharing bathrooms, but we had our own room. The price was reasonable, particularly given the holiday, but our room was painfully small, with the shower and toilet separated from the rest of the space by an awkward glass sliding door that didn't really give a ton of privacy. (The sink was in the main part of the room.) It was fine for the couple of days we stayed, but next time we'll try for a larger room. It was bare-bones but clean and had everything we needed. The lobby area is inviting, and it has its own little cafe window for coffee and pastries. The employees at the front desk were always helpful with recommendations when we asked. The hotel also offered a discount for Clinton Hall, the restaurant next door, which was phenomenal. It was super convenient to eat there, the food was delicious and creative (try the doughnut grilled cheese with tomato soup), and the vibe is super inviting with table games available to play while you wait for your food.","May 10, 2019","5    Pod 51 Hotel

Other things we enjoyed were: the clean [small, but totally OK] room. Nice beds. I liked the music they played in the hotel. I also appreciated the friendliness of the staff. The common space where people could sit and work, or just hang around near the reception was also great [the common area would improve even more if you installed a few USB-charges - comment from my teenage son]. We liked the bar in the common area, and had fruit sallad several times. Great also that you offer walking tours in NY for free to hotel guest. We'll try to take advantage of that next time we visit.The only drawback, no big deal, was that our room had no toilet in the room, or showed. That did not bother me, but my son would have preferred a toilet in the room. And I am not 100% sure that the hot water was working ok in ""toilet"" number 4, on floor 2 [the other showers were much warmer]. But these were really minor issues.

It was probably one of the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in but location makes up for this. The subway is right beside the hotel with a minutes walk. Times Square is no more than a 15 minute stroll and from there you can also walk to Central Park. All other attractions were easily reached by the subway.

The room at Pod 51 was much smaller than the room I had at Pod 39, but I was expecting a small room so this did not bother me much. The location is great and so is the price considering the location. My only complaint is the bathroom is SO small, even the shower! You can barely wash your hair without the rainfall shower rinsing it out at the same time- they may have been better off with a regular shower head or making the shower a little bigger. It's also nearly impossible to change in the bathroom because of how small it is. Other than that everything was very clean and we greatly enjoyed our stay. One tip- request a high floor!! We were on the third floor and since the room is small our room was so hot even with the heat completely off (there is no AC in the winter). We wanted to open the window to be able to sleep, but being in Manhattan it was noisy all night so neither of us slept well.","January 7, 2019","5    Pod 51 Hotel

321,"It’s all about the location and affordability with this hotel. It’s very clean and comfortable the hotel and rooms (rooms as you might have guessed are a little on the small side-but as everyone says your not really in your room much as your out exploring the amazing NYC). My wife and I found the room totally fine, we only had carry on backpacks with us,no luggage taking up room space). We think the rooms are cool in the way they have laid them out and used every bit of space possible. Rooms are super clean, and warm (stayed in December).we had a queen bed and our own private bathroom, although every single time we walked through the corridors to go to lift we noticed all the shared bathrooms where always available (we poked our heads in to one,to have a quick look while it was vacant and they where spotlessly clean, very spacious and very safe-it’s one toilet and one shower In the one bathroom, so you won’t actually be in there with anyone else, you use your key to open the bathroom door and lock it once in there. Very private! We said we will save a lil money next time and pay for a room with shared bathroom). Found the hotel to be of a complete mixed age range. Young, middle aged, older (70s,80s+), singles, couples, friends, groups. Great vibe!! My only set back from giving it 5 stars is the doors slamming through the night. When people enter or leave their room the doors do make a loud metal bang, I really hope they invest in fixing this as it would easily be a 5 if we didn’t get woke up a few times in the middle of the night in our comfy bed to loud slamming from doors). The best parts - location! Great central spot,5 min walk to Rockefeller center , st Patrick’s, grand terminal etc etc, but it’s quiet away from all the hustle and bustle of Times Square (you’ll appreciate the 5-10min walk at the end of the day to go back and chill from walking all day). One of our highlights of our NYC trip was getting up real early (5.30am) and walking around the corner to ess-a-bagel to grab an amazing filled bagel for breakfast with a cup of coffee.the most tastey filled bagel there is.it was still dark at that time, you get a really cool feel to NYC at that time,it’s more quieter (still bustling tho lol), you’ll see locals heading off early to work,see deliveries coming and going,and after your bagel go for a nice fresh,early morning walk with your coffee around the blocks and take it all in, brilliant). As we went first thing to ess a bagel there where only maybe 10 people in the que, as we walked past later in the afternoon there where ques out the door and down the street, what a total hotspot, for obvious reasons, so if staying at pod51 go grab breakfast early there).. last but no least, is the amazing roof terrace (again go early as no one will be up there). Go up to the top floor on lift and follow the signs up the stairs leading you out to the roof terrace. What amazing views, unreal. We had the place to ourselves (around 9am) for lots of cool photos and to really take in that we where in NYC. We will 100% stay again, looking forward to returning,just hope the door slamming noises gets sorted :) :) 5 stars for location, price, cleanliness, safeness and comfort.","January 2, 2019","5    Pod 51 Hotel

I called the hotel DIRECTLY and was advised I could check in at 10 am. I arrived at the hotel only to be told they had no rooms available because check in is at 3 PM. Having flown across the country to get to NYC for my follow up flight, I was HIGHLY annoyed that I was lied to by the hotel reservations staff. Had I was aware of this situation I would’ve booked an Airbnb. Checking in at 3 is useless because I have to start heading back to the airport at 5.

328,"We spent five days here and were bowled over by the size of the rooms for midtown New York which usually are very small. We had a ‘King Suite’ which was basically a large room with a small kitchen, this was exactly as we had requested and was perfect for our needs. Each room is owned by a different person in this 1920s building built by William Randolph Hearst and so each has its own decor. My wife didn’t like the green or the Japanese approach to those of our room owner but frankly this was a minor detail.Breakfast is a bit peculiar in an American Diner (American Cut) next door which is not actually part of the hotel and the range is quite small. Addition of fresh fruit and a bit more organisation by the staff would be helpful but breakfast is thrown in for free and so we shouldn’t complain too much!The location by Lex and 56th is perfect for all local synagogues - 5 mins to Central and 20 mins to Park East.

331,"My husband and I stayed at The Lombardy Hotel for 7 nights.Firstly the location is excellent . It is a short walking distance to many shops (eg Bloomingdales and Victoria Secrets) and eating places. There is a pizza place across the road. A ten minute walk to the MOMA and to the edge of Central Park. 12 minutes to the Rockefeller centre .It is a 5 minute walk to the subway. Secondly the apartment style accomodation appeared to be good value for money for New York. Our apartment was spacious, clean and modern with a kitchenette with fridge and microwave and a lounge room (with table and chairs) that could be shut off from the main bedroom with sliding doors. The hotel is quiet has a nice feel to it however we found the service to be lacking. Staff just seemed to be disinterested. We stayed for 7 nights and walked in and out of the front door to the hotel maybe 6 times a day and only when we initiated a hello or a greeting did we get an acknowledgement from staff at the front door. We certainly didn’t feel welcomed or that there was any interest into how our day went or what we were doing. On occasions when we asked for assistance from the door man he was aloof and disinterested.As others have mentioned the breakfast is lacking. My understanding ,according to reception , is that breakfast commences at 7am however on several occasions during our stay breakfast was not ready at 7 and we found ourselves waiting until 7.30 until it was organised and we were able to eat breakfast. I would recommend this hotel for location and it’s spacious rooms. If the interaction between staff and guests improved it would certainly be a much better experience.

340,"This hotel comprises rooms owned by different people and therefore no two rooms are the same. We had a room with a lovely king size bed, small kitchenette (microwave, fridge, plates, cutlery etc.), table with two chairs, lounger, side tables, large tv, large shower area and bathroom. Soap, shampoo etc provided as well as towels. The space was larger than a normal hotel room.The hotel is well situated and only a few blocks from Central Park. Three small blocks from the subway (59th St.). There's a doorman, somewhere to store luggage, friendly front desk staff, lobby seating. There are two lifts but one is undergoing maintenance so there can be waiting involved around breakfast time.Breakfast is included in the price and served in the American Cut restaurant accessed through the hotel lobby area. You do need to grab a voucher from the front desk as it is required to enter the restaurant area. Takeaway food and coffee is available but there is lots of seating. Food includes toast (3 breads), cereal (x2), oatmeal (in packets), scrambled egg (sometimes a bit overcooked), potato gems, bacon (beautifully crisp) and small sausages (a bit bland at times), pastries (3-4 types and warmed and fresh), Greek yoghurt and fruit. Coffee is from urns but not bad. Teabags (a strange range) are also available. Staff are not always engaged with their work but friendly and helpful enough if asked something.There is some building work going on just across the road so there is some noise from time to time but, hey, this is New York and there's always noise anyway.

Our spacious one bedroom suite on the10th floor was newly renovated and served our needs for sure. Unfortunately we hesitate to go back because our room felt a bit too stark and dark. Light fixtures were ample but only in the ceiling which made it impossible to read when seated on the couch. (The couch was big but only one part was comfortable to sit on.) I did ask for a floor lamp and the front desk found one right away. Odd too was that there was only the bathroom mirror making dressing up formally a bit challenging.

353,"What a disappointment. This is not so much a hotel as hotel theater -- a company pretending to be running a hotel. The staff was completely indifferent -- desk clerks, the so-called concierge who doubled as the bell staff so was not available to any appreciable extent in either capacity, or the doorman, who barely opened the door during our entire five night stay. We had a complimentary breakfast which required us to obtain a voucher each morning from the front desk, I suppose because the completely incompetent and indifferent restaurant staff could not be trusted to figure it out themselves. The breakfast was hardly worth it. It was literally fully self-serve, including water and coffee. No one seemed capable of pouring a drink. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage all badly overcooked; toasters that took forever to toast a single piece of bread. Our room was spacious and had a kitchenette with a coffee maker, coffee filters, and an electric tea kettle, but there was no coffer provided or a single tea bag available. Complimentary bottles of water where provided when we arrived but never replenished. There was a level of remarkable indifference by everyone who worked there. The single amenity worth mentioning was the wi-fi, which worked like a charm. That's something I guess. Our suggestion -- don't bother, especially at the rates the Lombardy charges. Only a few blocks south on Lexington you will find several high quality hotels that are much better and who seem to understand the concept of hospitality.","December 10, 2018","6    The Lombardy

354,"My first stay for two nights at Lombardy was excellent-I had no idea that this old residence hotel was actually redone! I had a beautiful, quiet modern room! I definitely wanted to return. I booked two back to back reservations, one for four nights, one for two nights. I tried to request the same room I stayed in, but the front desk told me that this room type wasn't available. Instead, they would give me a King Suite. Ok, I thought-I'll take it!! They would not let me stay in the same room for my entire 6-night stay, which I felt was unaccomodating.Unfortunately, the room was a strange mix of old, kitschy furnishings. It was huge. But, I felt like I entered a time warp I could not escape for four nights. No wall plugs in the right places, no wall plugs in the bathroom, no dresser, very strange leopard carpeting, and very old, furnishings that weren't updated. There was even an old push button phone I couldn't believe actually worked. Since I had discussed my stay numerous times by phone with the front desk, I didn't feel I could move to another room. They assured me that I could move to my previous room on my second two-night reservation, so I decided to stick it out. What else could I do?? So, I don't know what the other rooms are like? Strange, old, not updated like my four night stay? Or modern and redone, like my favorite room? Due to the fact that I was unable to choose my room type for my four night stay, I probably will not return. It was very inconvenient for many reasons, and didn't feel comfortable or luxurious at all, despite the room size. Also, the front desk wasn't that friendly at times, and just seemed like grumpy old men.","December 1, 2018","6    The Lombardy

Rooms are comfortable but don't expect nice views from them. The other aspect that needs to be improved is breakfast, very poor, far from our expectations for a hotel with such a high rate. As a conclusion, we expected more value regarding the price we paid, although is a nice location with a comfortable bed.

356,What a find! Lovely hotel and great location. They upgraded is to a huge suite. Beautiful big room huge comfy bed. 2 bathrooms and kitchen with huge lounge area. On the 5th floor not a great view but didn't mind as mostly out. It was great to come back to a lovely place each night. Breakfast was buffet and fine. Nice hotel bar. Couldn't believe how quiet and sound proof the hotel was. We have stayed at a few more expensive hotels and you could still here the noise and sirens etc but not here ! Very impressed. We stayed 2 nights before a cruise from Cape liberty. When we returned from the cruise the hotel even let us leave our luggage here while we did some more sight seeing before our flight back home. Also good location for sightseeing. Not far from Bloomingdale's and Central Park. Definitely recommend this hotel. Little gem!,"November 3, 2018","6    The Lombardy

But the hidden gem was in the lower lobby, the salon! Specifically the stylist Annie. She only cuts men's hair and my wife booked me with Annie for a shave and a haircut. The shave was soooo relaxing. I think I might have fallen asleep. And the cut was without a doubt the best haircut I've had. Annie was so nice and easy to talk to and the attention to detail was impeccable. I couldn't thank her or more especially, my wife for such a great weekend!","November 1, 2018","6    The Lombardy

358,"The Lombardy in New York in Midtown East (56 St between Lex and Park) is a great location for visitors. The hotel offers condos which are large apartments that have kitchens so families can enjoy a meal in their room. If you are a couple, the king studio is spacious with 560 sq feet of living space and offers a kitchen as well. The room was very clean and the cleaning staff was very attentive. All condos are different so the King studio I had was simple, no frills furnishings but comfortable, clean and easy living while away from home. When there was an issue with the internet, service was attentive and immediate. The breakfast and internet are included but if staying more than two or three days the breakfast is totally boring and unimaginative. All in all, this is a property worth considering.

360,"At almost $400/nite before taxes this was an expensive hotel for us, but it was a short, luxury trip to Manhattan celebrating our anniversary. The Lombardy is on 56th Street between Park and Lexington. Only a few blocks from Bloomingdales in one direction, Central Park in another and Rockefeller Center in another. Very safe and walkable neighborhood.My only complaint was that one of they two elevators was out during our five nite stay so some mornings we just walked down the five flights of stairs to the lobby rather than wait for a full elevator from the higher floors. However while we were checking out the elevator repairmen were there fixing it.The breakfast in the American Cut steakhouse is fine and in a nice setting. The same thing every day, scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage and various breads. They also had yogurt with fruit but that often ran out.We ate one nite in the American Cut for dinner. Pricy but convenient. I recommend the hotel. Our room was generally quiet and quite large with a small kitchenette.","October 24, 2018","6    The Lombardy

361,"NOT AT ALL AS ADVERTISED. Cannot believe they charge what they do for this place. I checked out the same night that I checked in (last minute booked a different hotel entirely) because the condition of my room was in such shocking contrast with the images they use to portray their rooms/amenities. The discrepancies between what Hotel Lombardy promotes vs. the reality of what third-party-booking customers actually get is nothing short of astounding. I understand that room choice is up to the discretion of the hotel, and that images shown in profiles aren't of the exact room(s) that customers will be given; HOWEVER, this situation is entirely different: they are featuring images of their most aesthetically-appealing, most updated rooms, which mislead customers to believe that the room they’ll be given will at least, to some degree, meet some basic expectations. This is not at all the case. My room’s condition was unacceptable. Dirty towels were left behind; the bed didn’t have more than 2 pillows and 2 sheets; the AC unit was caked in dust, mold and dirt; the hotel boasts that it's rooms have walk-in closets but mine had 1 super tiny coat-sized closet with only 2 hangers available for use; the floor plan was completely partitioned of, with the kitchen being positioned awkwardly off a lobby narrow entry hallway, so small that 2 people couldn’t fit in it at the same time and with a door that blocked the room's main door if it were open, so it constantly had to remain shut - very claustrophobic; grime and dirt caked the mirrors, floors, bathtub, light switches; the floor was decades-old stained rough carpeting, unlike the hardwood floors you see in the images; the lighting was terrible, given off solely by 3-4 mismatched floor lamps haphazardly placed in spots around the room; the couch was so worn that the edges were ripped and the cushions sagging far into the interior; the updated/modern kitchens and bathrooms are a far cry from the 60s-looking situation that I had to deal with (so outdated that rust covered hardware, faucets leaked, fridge wasn't bolted into place so moved whenever you tried to open it). Customer service was basically nonexistent. I asked if there were other rooms available to which I could move, but was told they were sold out for the night - this was a blatant and pointed lie, as I immediately checked a third-party booking app and saw 2 rooms still listed as available.","October 19, 2018","6    The Lombardy

The hotel was much as I remembered it, the location is excellent for walking to many of the mid town attractions such as 5th Avenue, Central Park, Empire State Rockerfeller, and Times Square. There are also convenient restaurants bars, cafes and convenience stores. The room we had was large but not as individual as I remembered from previous visits, but there bathroom and shower was excellent. the room came with a fridge, and mini kitchen if you wanted to prepare a bit of food for yourself. High quality linens and a really comfortable king size bed. A real additional plus was the free breakfast with a good selection of food, excellent bacon! They need to improve the toasters though. It wasn't a bargain at around £280 per night but certainly competitive with other upper range mid town hotels, I like the fact that it's not a chain and has an individual quality to it.

Other hotel details: Great room, super-comfy beds. Could hear the noise from the street (I was on the 4th floor) but still slept like a baby. The lobby bar had weird hours. Always seemed to have to wait for an elevator as the other 2 elevators were taken over by the Manhattan club, whatever that is.

The room was a king and we were told by the member of staff that took our bags up that all accessible rooms were king. There were no accessible twins so they wouldnt have told the agency this so seems fault lies with agency. He went out of his way to help and arranged for a roll away bed to be brought up, for which we were not charged. The room didn't have a view but made up for by the room itself.

390,"It is my 6th time visiting New York City and this was the worst yet. Yesterday, me and my family had a flight to New York from Chicago. After a 2 hour flight we wanted to check-in our hotel. When we got to the hotel it was so noisy in the lobby. They said the hotel check-in time would be around 16.00, we waited for 2 hours to finally check-in to our room. We waited the housekeepers to “clean” our room and they said we will call you when your room is ready. (Which they never did.) After 2 hours we FINALLY checked-in and we went to our room. When we opened the door everthing seemed fine until my mom screamed. There was a lady in our bathroom, alone and without any cleaning equipments, so that made us scared a little bit. We waited for about 45 mins for our luggages. They never arrived. And after waiting 5 more minutes we decided to go downstairs to check our bags. The woman in the reception tried her best but she couldn’t manage to help us. Eventually we got our luggage (after around an hour) and because we were tired, we decided to sleep. Because the windows were not thick enough we heard every single sound in the street and New York could be the nosiest city in the whole world but It was like sleeping on the street. (My mom couldn’t sleep) All in all if you are coming to New York please don’t select this hotel. ","July 2, 2019","7    Park Central Hotel New York

391,"Let's start off by saying, the one and only single positive experience was the 2 ladies at check-in!!! They were great... awesome personalities and very welcoming/helpful.... Where to begin? I guess it'll be simpler to just list them out- Room was a single/king with a shower/tub bathroom- The room was extremely dated and worn, i do mean extremely worn- Bathroom, is dated, extremely cramped, worn but functional- Bathroom, be careful with the hot water.. it is extremely HOT- No coffee/tea maker- Rooms are not very sound proof- Seems no communication between departments, requested late check out; knock on the door early asking if i was checking out; then security came by later and asked if i was checking out... all of this was prior to the 1:00 p.m. check out- Wasn't notified of the construction; woke up to drilling/cutting/grinding next door... - Heating/Cooling - the A/C unit was finicky; set them temp then set the fan to High, it'd reset after a few seconds.. did the multiple times... before it actually locked in and actually worked; adjusted temp then started the whole process againOverall first impression, definitely not great.... then again.. it could be a one off bad experience....","July 1, 2019","7    Park Central Hotel New York

392,"First off the hotel charges a ridiculous “Facility Fee”. I stayed there for 6 nights and the Facility Fee was nearly $250. That then pushes the cost of the hotel into another price tier and it just doesn’t offer enough amenities to warrant being in that tier. After a conversation with Elizabeth and Nancy at the front desk they agreed to waive it. Thank you to them both. The good: when you take the fee out of the equation there is great value for the money here. The basic room is adequate size for 1-2 people with an average hotel size bathroom. It’s nothing noteworthy but it’s very reasonable for Manhattan at the price point (excluding the fee of course). There’s a lounge area and a gym but not a restaurant or much else in the way of amenities (for instance no in room fridge) but again compared to what other nearby hotels are charging, I’m ok with those not being there. The location is perfect for exploring midtown. A 10 minute walk will get you to Times Square, Columbus Circle, Central Park or 5th Ave. There’s a good mix of restaurants within walking distance, both in terms of price range and cuisine. Carnegie Hall, Broadway, Radio City are all within walking or short cab ride distance. Were it not for the Facility Fee I’d probably give them a 5 star rating but I’m taking a star off because when you factor in the cost of the fee, the amenities and size of the room are sorely lacking for what it ends up costing. No fee: 5 star. With fee: 3 star, so I’ve split the difference and given it a 4. ","June 29, 2019","7    Park Central Hotel New York

She did everything she could to ease our situation, and she even helped/guided us to solve our personal issues.Elizabeth, thank you so much! You are an amazing professional and an amazing PERSON.

394,"We opted to spend a little more on accommodation during our trip to NYC to avoid any nasty surprises, and this one did the trick. It's well located, easy walk from Central Park and Time Square and with lots of diners around. The room was large and clean. No extras though, and the only breakfast on offer in the hotel is a small coffee counter so plan to spend money on all three meals. Also, note the extra fee of 35$ per night at the end of your stay.","June 28, 2019","7    Park Central Hotel New York

395,"The location of this hotel was perfect for this trip. It is right across from Carnegie Hall and a short walk to Time Square. I have visited NYC numerous times and stayed in a lot of different hotels. The rooms at this hotel are larger than normal which makes it better for multiple people in one room. There were a lot of groups staying at this hotel. Mostly attending Carnegie Hall events. That made check in and out a little more congested and the elevator too but nothing to complain about. There is not a fridge or a coffee maker in the rooms. So if that is important to you, choose something else. The staff was not anything extra ordinary but nothing to complain about either. Overall, if you are looking for a clean room, in a great location, that offers a larger room, than this is a good option. ","June 26, 2019","7    Park Central Hotel New York

396,"We loved our stay at the Park Central Hotel! The location is amazing—seriously, we lucked out on that—had no idea how good! The subway is on the corner, Starbucks is just a few doors down, Times Square is a few blocks one way and Central Park is a few blocks the other. The staff was polite and prompt to get anything we requested to our room. I gave it a 5-star review, but there were a couple things I wasn’t crazy about (definitely NOT deal breakers!). First, there were only two operating elevators to get us to our room on the 8th floor, and they were extremely small. It wasn’t a huge deal but got to be difficult a few times getting to our room; they were very crowded and not always able to get everyone on. The room was great—we did the standard with two double beds—but the bathroom didn’t have a fan and got very hot and steamy after showers—wasn’t crazy about that, either. Speaking of showers, I LOVED the bath products (C.O. Bigelow—full-size bottles of shampoo and conditioner and body wash in the shower, travel-sized bottles of lotion in the bathroom—new ones everyday!) and the housekeeping staff did a great job keeping us clean!Our stay was better than I expected, and I will definitely stay there when I go back to NYC!!

397,For me the location was ideal. Couple of min walk away from Central Park and Times Square. Subway station for both down town and updated it uptown right out side the hotel. The hotel itself was clean and modern. Staff were friendly and even helped find a jazz band worth watching. Good size room. Having a bath instead of a shower in the room was nice. Only down side was the view looking onto the side of buildings.,"June 23, 2019","7    Park Central Hotel New York

After more than a frustrating hour of being on the phone with them and Mr. Hightower intervening, it was to no avail. It was not a pleasant start at the hotel, but Mr. Hightower did his best to save the day. He gave us a coupon for coffee and a drink and secured us another night’s stay at a better rate. His genuine warmth and compassion helped ease a difficult situation, all the while telling us, “enjoy yourselves because you’re on vacation”.

The second time I tried to call I was told someone would call me back but I am still waiting. I paid $150 for 2 nights of parking and expected that my items would be safe.

The beds are ridiculously comfy and the cleaning staff does their job well. I’ve really enjoyed my time here and I couldn’t be happier. On top of it, the staff spoke at least 4 languages from what I observed (English, French, Italian and Spanish).

409,"This Stay was awesome. I checked in with my wife and 1 year old. The rooms were comfortable and the beds were nice and clean as well. Just a couple blocks away from Central Park where we had dinner at Tavern on the Green. Highly recommend this Restaurant located in the middle of central park. Make reservations close to sunset so you can enjoy the magic under the lights. Visit the Zoo and catch a ride on the Horse and Carriage that are waiting to take you on a nice 45 minute stroll through the park. So far our experience at Park Central hotel is 4.5 stars. I would have gave it a 5 star review but the elevators were so slow they were almost non functioning, so we took the stairs. Good thing we were on the 4th floor!

412,"Chose Park Central based on proximity to Carnegie Hall (just a 1-2 block easy walk). Very friendly guest service staff, and helpful concierge. Very nice sitting area that becomes a night lounge on the main floor behind guest services. Had a deluxe 2 queen. No ""view"" with scaffolding outside our window, but premier rooms avail if you want a ""view"". Our room faced CPark (north?) and was not noisy with a good shade. Very pleased with bed comfort and cleanliness (the bathroom was spotless). Rooms are as depicted in website pics. On line reservations and express check out easy. Great location for walking to CPark, Rockefeller Center, St Patrick's Church, Times Square and parts of Broadway. Curb side hotel staff conscientious of loading / unloading zones and pleasant. Facilities fee seems overpriced, but fitness room was nice. It was on the third floor if you want to the convenience of being on the same floor. Right by hotel same side of street / same block is a nice Deli (good omelets but one staff / owner a bit rude), Starbuck's (usually busy), Coffee Shop (less busy and great items), and Fancy Apple for bike rentals. Would definitely recommend. 4 of 5 rating based on: 1) Long elevator lines so need to plan your departure times for anything in advance; stairs were well lit as a second option for those who could; 2) Would be nice to have more option for filling water bottles but the tap water in the room tasted okay to us.

415,"My family and I recently stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks. We chose the classic 2 double bed room as we are a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids). The beds were nice and spacious. Room size is adequate. However, I must say for the price we were paying (more or less $350/day all taxes and fees included) the rooms were not well maintained. The drawers on the TV console table were all broken at the hinges, very troublesome to use. No free bottled water for daily consumption. Aside from the usual hand soap, lotion, shampoo and conditioner, no other toiletries were privided. No electric kettle in the room, we had to request for one. No chiller in the room also. Another thing I must add is that there were not enough elevators! This is a very busy hotel due to its location. There is a constant line at the elevators. Also due to the fact that the elevators can fit only a few people at a time. And most times only 1 elevator is functioning per wing. Other than its excellent location, this hotel is just mediocre when it comes to quality and service. ","June 6, 2019","7    Park Central Hotel New York

418,"I stayed with my family for 6 nights over the Easter break. We chose this hotel because of its excellent midtown location close to Central Park. It didn’t disappoint!I have to say that I’m not a fan of the NYC practice of hotels charging daily fees. It’s far simpler to include them in the room rate, paid up front. I understand it’s not just this hotel, but all NYC hotels, but nevertheless it’s extremely irritating. Park Central did include some extras though, such as a discount at the hotel bar, which was nice. The fittings are in good condition, albeit somewhat dated. If I could point out something, it’s that the shower curtain in the bathroom was too short. We enjoyed our stay in a family room with 2 double beds. The staff were pleasant and friendly, and went out of their way to make our stay easier. There are no coffee and tea facilities in room, but there is a Starbucks on the ground floor, and the hotel lobby also has a small coffee shop. The best thing about our stay was location - Central Park is 5 minutes walk away, the major museums like the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are reasonably walkable distances away too. So is Times Square. For anything else, the subway entrance is practically on the same block. There’s no real reason to stay in the hotel, so we didn’t really make use of any in house facilities.

421,"This hotel is centrally located to Times Square and Central Park, yet just far enough from Times Square to avoid some of the intensity of that location. It is very convenient to the Theater District.The property is an older property but has been very well maintained and it did not feel like an older property. The rooms were clean, quiet, and more than adequate.There is no on-site restaurant, but there are many restaurants within a block or two for breakfast or lunch.The Bar area is very upscale and comfortable. The bar hostess, Nancy, made us feel very much at-home and treated us like family. Meeting her was one of the highlights of our trip!The only real negative to the property is the elevator situation. At one time it appeared that this property had a total of 8 elevators, 4 for each side. There are now only two elevators per side. One side serves the higher floors, one the lower floors. This works OK when the elevators are all working. During our visit one of the two elevators serving our floors was out of service for about a day and a half. This caused major queues to access the remaining elevator.The outside of the building is also under some sort of refurbishment, so our outside view was somewhat blocked by scaffolding and safety screening. We were not in the room much so this was not a major issue.This was our third visit to NYC and our third hotel.

426,"I have stayed at the Park Central a number of times and would not hesitate to book it again. It is a beautiful, well-kept hotel in a great location. You are minutes from Times Square without being in the middle of the chaos. A few blocks in the other direction is Central Park. The rooms are spacious, the beds comfortable and many of the rooms have great views. I love that the bathrooms have tubs and are already stocked with really nice products in large containers. If I have ever needed anything I have found the staff responds quickly and are always very pleasant to deal with. I would definitely recommend this hotel.","May 24, 2019","7    Park Central Hotel New York

430,"I have stayed at Park Central Hotel in past years and it never disappoints. Literally minutes after check-in on my last stay in April, I received both an email and a phone call from Guest Relations asking if everything was good with my room - it was - quiet clean, comfortable and well appointed! Director of Guest Relations Quimby Hightower helped me out with a couple small special requests that made my day! Conveniently located midtown/west, Park Central Hotel is kitty corner from Carnegie Hall, easy walking distance to Broadway, shopping and beautiful Central Park. The N&R subway stop is located at the end of the block to get you anywhere you want to go. Seventh Avenue is busy day and night so I always feel safe walking by myself. Park Central has a very international flair with an excellent restaurant lounge on the main floor and there was even live music on one of the nights I was there!","May 21, 2019","7    Park Central Hotel New York

431,"Booked a standard room well in advance and having been there last year we were looking forward to our visit. We opted to upgrade to a suite. The suite was lovely, sitting room, bedroom and 2 massive bathrooms but sadly only about a foot of usable closet space, jacket/shirt/blouse length. So we moved back to a standard room,433. This was not a good room, apart from it had a closet. The area near the basin in the bathroom was peppered with other people's toothpaste yuk. The edge of the carpet has not been vacuumed for a long time. The 'fluff' was at least a centimetre thick. Noise from the fans in the atrium was loud early morning. We went to the customer service desk but people were being told the hotel was full and no chance of a move until that changed. We didn't bother to queue to complain, better things to do so we sucked it up and went and had a couple of cocktails in the bar. The hotel is in a great location being between Central Parka and Times Sq. The Consierge was a gem in helping us navigate our way around the city. The staff in general were pleasant and helpful. The bar staff made brilliant cocktails. I just wish we hadn't opted to upgrade as I feel we lost a better standard room in doing so.

433,They gave us a horrible room first day and after a long debate they agreed to change it next day. The rooms are outdated and you need to wait for around 20 minutes to take an elevator. They made several mistake in room charges as I was overcharged several times and had to pass by the reception almost daily to correct the charges and every time around 30 minutes wasted. Won’t stay there again. The only good thing was complementary dinner finger buffet during week days and free laundry.,"July 7, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

434,"While the hotel was passable especially for NYC, our trip was almost ruined by the long lines waiting to use the elevator. It took up to 20 minutes if your room was on a upper floor. One elevator out of three was out completely and when it was repaired someone was stuck the next morning and the fire department was called(I happen to be sitting downstairs when they showed up). The same day elevator #1 lurched and scary to ride. I moved the second day to a lower floor because originally I was on floor 32 and feared that the elevator situation would get worse. The rooms were clean, however the air conditioning in my second room was inadequate. (In my first room the air conditioner was great, but the tv did not work, even after asking someone to fix it)","July 2, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

435,We check in this past Saturday not thinking anything and excited to spend a day exploring the city with the family. We get into the room start getting ready to leave and our kids are explorers like all children. I come out of the bathroom to see my son hanging out the window from the 27th floor. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first scared and didn't want his to get him nervous and move any further. I approached him and got him out of harm's way. When I went to go talk to management they told me that was the law for windows to open. I stay in many hotels during the year and that's obviously not the case he had no idea what he was talking about. But in fact just probably didn't want to deal with it and walked away..... There were no child protective locks anywhere on the window how could thay be. If I didn't come out of the bathroom when I did. It could have ended much different. Shame on you and an even bigger shame on you for not being understanding of my fear and anxiety. I almost lost my son. This is not the experience I expected to have. There was no mention of windows opening upon checkin even though they seen we had two toddlers. If you are planning on staying at this hotel and have children be aware so you dont have to experience what me and my wife just went through.,"July 2, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

The view was lovely but we couldn’t believe we had this room as I had booked it 3 days ago through Bookings.com!The receptionist, called Jovi, suggested that as I had a cane, it maybe a good idea to borrow/hire a wheelchair for the 7 days as my friend has been here before & wanted me to see all these places & all these things of New York. Jovi the receptionist, said it would be better if it gets too hectic here it would be much better in a wheelchair!

Now the block is almost entirely similar hotels, there is one ‘interesting’ liquor store- but I wonder if that’s more of a living museum now. Then the world’s biggest subway station has an entrance 50 m a away- although you can walk right to the other side of Time Square underground should you do wish. I’d stay there again.

440,"We have stayed in many hotels all over the world. This must be one of the worst hotels we ever stayed in and how this hotel got a 4.5 rating we very unsure of. We travelled the USA for 4 weeks and this was the most disappointing hotel by far and was our biggest mistake on our 4 week tour.The only 2 positive things we can say about this hotel was the check-inn late night by a very helpful gentleman Paul and the fact that he organised to get our valuables out of the safe that we forgot. The rest was just depressing. The breakfast was included and ok, just very ok. Besides Paul, we were not impressed with the rest of the staff. Very unhelpful. Stayed in NYC previously and this hotel for us was situated in a rundown horrible part of the city with tons of homeless people and scaly characters. It’s 100% not soundproof and we had extreme difficulty in sleeping. It is a very dirty run down place. The carpets in the lifts were filthy. They hardly cleaned up after someone left their table at breakfast. Our curtains were halfway broken and the table lamp hanged all skew. We waited forever for the lift. Not on one occasion, but every single day. Our mugs were not washed, although we payed for cleaning services. I won't recommend this hotel even to my biggest enemy. We were extremely disappointed. There are so many other great hotels in NYC, don’t bother to look at this one.","June 7, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

441,"Yes, there are so many places you could stay in New York City. In fact, it could give you a headache researching all of them to find just the right one. Or, you could try a different one every visit. But this one was well worth returning to again knowing it was pretty good. While I may, I probably will not try a different IHG Hotel in the Times Square area; I always try to stay at IHG properties when possible.This hotel was in the middle of it all. We arrived in the early afternoon and although they were very busy, we were greeted immediately by a friendly staff. The check in process was quick and easy and we were greeted as being loyal guests. We were offered information regarding things to do in the area and asked where we were coming from and headin to. When we indicated we were flying home the next day we were offered the choice of speaking to someone about transportation to the airport, which we took advantage of. We were able to have them arrange a private car and driver for almost the same price as a taxi.Our special requests made in advance were honored. Our room was very clean and modern. Everything worked fine I wish there was better water pressure in the shower but we were on the top floor and that may have made a difference. They also only put one bar of soap by the bathroom sink because they have shower gel but that is my preference to have two bars. The wifi worked great. The breakfast was just okay. If you are on a high floor you should allow yourself enough time to leave the building because you may have to wait a few extra minutes for an elevator with enough room.I did NOT like the bed! Some sort of memory foam that made it difficult to roll over during the night and it raised up between us in the middle like a mountain from the sea.Overall, especially considering the price, it is a place I will stay at again.","June 2, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

442,"We booked a King Suite, as it appeared from the website to be a nice, well equipped room with enough space to chill out on the period between chasing around New York and going out for dinner. The ‘suite’ is just a regular hotel room with a small cooker, dish washer (for some reasons) and a fridge. One chair that you cannot sit at because it is under the air conditioner. The bed is the only place in which to chill, which is not what I usually expect in a suite, even in New York.(see picture)The rooms are extremely tired and it doesn’t feel at all clean.Breakfast is dreadful and we have waited until we could find somewhere to eat out on all but the first two days. Despite being ‘free’, it isn’t worth doing.The street is very sketchy and the hotel is a couple of doors down from a parole office, and it shows by the crowds of people in the streets harassing tourists, selling drugs and smoking weed, when they are not panhandling you.There are only three lifts, and during peak periods you can easily wait over half hour, which if you are on the 25th floor, is the only option.I genuinely cannot find anything in the hotel to recommend it, and I feel bad about that. Sure, it is only a couple of blocks from Times Square, but that just adds to the volume of hustlers trying to separate you from your money.We paid $350 a night, which isn’t bargain basement, even for New York.My advice is to look elsewhere, it is truly a place that is weeks away from being torn down.","May 30, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

Plenty of staff on hand to keep food available and tables cleaned off as soon as someone gets up. Room was small but most importantly, clean!!! Bathroom was spacious but shower was tiny and ours had a broken seal so water got all over outside the shower. The bed and pillow were AMAZING. I felt like I was falling into a cloud every night. I would bag them up and bring them home as my NY keepsake if I could have. Earlier post mentioned that down the street towards Times Square is seedy. The Department of Correctional Custody day program didn't bother me as much as the liquor store and the half dozen men sitting around it getting more sloshed as the day wore on. We learned to just walk on the other side of the street and then just cross over in front of the hotel. The only reason I didn't give this hotel a 5 is because of the elevators - they are tiny, ancient and slow. And in the mornings you share them with the housekeepers with their arms full of bedding and towels.

452,"My husband & I stayed at Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City 4/18 - 4/23 (5 nights). We paid $1,676.26. Our review:ARRIVAL/CHECK-IN: We arrived between 7-8p on a Thursday & were greeted by a very friendly representative (Monae?). She mentioned our wedding anniversary & surprised us with a goodie bag. She explained the costs very clearly, including the refundable deposit ($50/day) & housekeeping charges ($5/day). I'd say check-in took < 5 minutes.ROOM• Bath: Small, but modern. Hot water every day, water pressure varied. My only suggestion would be for the hotel to add one or two more towel hooks to the wall.• Bed: King-sized, very comfortable like other IHG properties I've stayed at!• Heating/cooling: Room stayed at a comfortable temp, but the unit is quite noisy if you're watching TV.• Housekeeping: Satisfactory. Not sure why they charge (is this a common practice with all NYC hotels?). We requested housekeeping 2 days = $10 & had to verify the charges w/ the hotel at check-out (we were charged 1 extra day).• Kitchenette: Surprisingly well-stocked, i.e. cups, ice tray, plates. Very nice to have a refrigerator & microwave during our stay.• Safe: Very useful amenity.• Sound: It's NYC, so be prepared for noise. Even on floor # 29 we could hear honking, sirens, & even the occasional person hollering outside. As well as other guests slamming doors & a baby crying. None of the noise interrupted my sleep though.• TV: Mostly news & sports stations. Unfortunately, several stations had spotty or no signals.• View: Prior to arrival, we requested a room on a high floor facing the Empire State Building. We were assigned room 2909 & the view was fabulous! Photo attached. In retrospect, I would give up the view for a lower floor so we could take the stairs vs waiting for an elevator.HOTEL• Breakfast: Selection is so so compared to other IHG properties. Very busy at all hours of service. I would not choose this hotel based on breakfast alone.• Customer service: Top notch! Monae(?) & the bartender on Monday 4/22 evening were incredibly friendly!• Elevator: As other reviews have stated, the wait times are long & the elevators very, very crowded. However, we did not want to walk down 29 flights of stairs so we waited.• Laundry facilities: 3 washers & 3 dryers available to use for free. Be warned: several guests use the machines to wash 1-3 items at a time (I kid you not). And they do not keep an eye on their laundry, so you'll need to switch out other guest's laundry if you hope to get your items washed.LOCATION: Convenient for visitors planning to see a play, but awful if you need to catch a Lyft/Uber.• Tips? Request a room on a lower level so you can avoid using the elevator. • Would we recommend? Yes• Would we stay again? Perhaps. We'd likely stay in lower Manhattan if we ever visit again.","April 23, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

453,"I am a great fan of the ICHG group and stay 90% of the time in their hotels but never in this one again.In defence of the hotel this is a busy Easter weekend but that is no excuse for some of what we faced.For what we paid I have used before a nice hotel near central station but decided with a title ‘suites’ it might be a little functional but we might get a bit more room and a small kitchenette. Well we got the kitchenette but it was shoehorned into a standard small room.Staying on a high floor the elevators are a disaster- I appreciate they are stuck with the no. of lifts they have got but you can while away the hours awaiting your carriage or walk 20+ flights! They thoughtfully provide televisions outside the lift door and this Sunday morning I almost joined in the broadcast church service in hope that prayer would bring an elevator.But the worst experience was breakfast. Don’t blame the workers- blame the management. Not enough tables- not enough staff-tables were full of other people’s detritus and were not cleared, the few staff on duty could not keep up. We ran out of coffee, milk, bowls, knives etc etc. The girl on the next table was diligently trying to spread cheese with a spoon. The staff were disorganised -literally clearing a plate or two at a time- for heavens sake give them a tray so they can clear a whole table at a time and someone to watch over to see things run smoothly.As I said at the top - never again.","April 21, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

455,"Stayed here 8 nights of a 6 week family holiday to the United States. Great location, fantastic hotel with all the comforts of home. Elevators a problem, but can’t be fixed. Don’t let it ruin your stay. Front office staff could be a little more attentive to guests needs. David and Jamie who are the guest relations guys are great. Personable and helpful with helping with local attractions. Not to mention Jamie being a great guitar player. Will be staying here again. Thanks for a great time. We will miss you all.

456,We have just left the 32 storey Staybridge Suites near Times Square. For 3 days of our 3 day stay one of the elevators did not work. They did not call anyone into fix it! We walked along with many others.. down stairs 27 floors to breakfast!The rooms are super tiny and are not big enough for families. A lot of space is taken up with the kitchen and a full refrigerator and dishwasher! Although the hotel pantry has very little food or is there a grocery near by!The location is not bad close to a subway and 8th Avenue.There are many more better options nearby for this overpriced hotel!

458,"The hotel is situated just off the main Times Square area but is a short and convenient walk to most attractions. The bus terminal across the road provides easy access to other NY districts including buses to the Woodbury Outlet mall.Hotel itself is a bit old and the rooms are a little bit small compared to most other hotel suites that I am used to. However, this being in the heart of New York City, that is to be expected.The major problem with this hotel are the elevators that seem to be slow and always full. We stayed on the upper floors and had to sometime wait up to 15 minutes before we can get into an elevator. Bear this in mind if you need to rush out for an appointment especially during the peak morning hours.Unlike most hotels I stayed in before, the housekeeping is optional and there is a fee (I think US$5 per day) if you want the room to be cleaned daily.The breakfast offered is very basic but sufficient.The counter staff are not very friendly (maybe due to the hectic activity in the small reception area most of the time).","April 3, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

459,"We have stayed here before and loved it. This time there were a few glitches, but overall I would still recommend. First the positives: you get a free breakfast, you have a full kitchen, the rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable. Now the glitches: the kitchen sink in our unit stunk, the bathroom has a glass door and is right next to the bed making it difficult to use the bathroom if the other person is sleeping. They also charge a $5 a night fee if you want housekeeping services. We said on checkin that we did not want this service, but we still had to put the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door or they came knocking to clean every day. One last note, the elevator is noisy, try to get a room as far from it as possible.","March 29, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

The theaters and Central Park area were all within walking distance. Rooms are clean and well supplied. The staff at the hotel were welcoming and went above and beyond to provide a high level of customer service. Jove at the front desk was awesome and very helpful. Jose, the security guard, went out of his way to help my daughter and I get to a rooftop area at another hotel so we could get some. Igor pictures of the city. He not only got us into the hotel and to the rooftop but also showed us where the best pictures would be and stood talking to us telling us about the various things we were seeing.

We took full advantage of the continental breakfast, which was better than usual. Hot breakfast items, as well as a variety of fruit, yogart, cereals, baked goods.

That could have set the tone for the weekend, but for the outstanding staff working at this hotel. Literally every single employee had a smile, a helpful attitude, a professional understanding of their job, and a desire to make me feel welcome. Whether it was the desk staff dealing with computer issues, the management checking on the waiting guests, the cleaning staff who put everything to rights each day, or the positively outstanding speed and warmth of the young men clearing the breakfast dishes, literally every single employee I encountered was NICE to me. It really flipped the switch on my attitude. Our studio on the 13th floor was lovely, comfortable, spacious enough for us to move around freely and tricked out with every possible amenity. Since we stayed the end of January the rates were absurdly low, literally $600 for three nights with scrambled eggs, bacon and bagels for breakfast. I mean, seriously?

We got a great deal for a January trip and it is in a great location, walking distance from the bus terminal, Times Square, and subway stop. I take off 1 star for the elevator wait times, as others have mentioned, and the strange attitude of staff members. There’s a $5 charge for housekeeping each day, and we only did it once to avoid paying the fees. For $5 we got the trash taken out, fresh towels, and a made bed. Coffee and bath products were not refilled as is typical in a hotel, and I couldn’t get through to the front desk at all for over an hour to request more, and ended up coming by in the morning. The employee at that time said “we have coffee?” and seemed generally clueless. We also got the bill on our final day and had been charged for daily housekeeping, so I had to go dispute that with the front desk. It seems the front desk staff don’t really know what they’re doing.

482,"This hotel is very basic but we were just looking for a moderately priced hotel for a large group with a good location. Calling this hotel “Times Square” is stretching it, Hell’s Kitchen is more accurate. It was a decent walk to Times Square. We had 3 rooms 6 adults and 2 children. We called ahead and were able to get rooms on the same floor which worked out great. Rooms are small but it is very nice to have a kitchenette in the room. Unfortunately this is not a normal Staybridge that has a fold out couch. Expect long long waits for the elevators every time you try to leave your room. Every elevator going down is full and you will have to let quite a few go by before finding one with space. Breakfast was good but very busy. They luckily have multiple places to sit so that helps. We did have a difficult time getting our rooms cleaned. We left our rooms before 9 each day so there should not have been any problem with them getting into our rooms. One day we got back to the rooms before going out to dinner and housekeeping was still cleaning one of the rooms. One room had been cleaned but the third had not been touched. It was 7:00!! So we gathered in the one room that was finished expecting her to clean the other two rooms. We could hear her grumbling while she rushed through that room. The third room she threw clean towels on the bed and left.","January 15, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

The seating area is so small you won't find a seating place and the waitress was SHOUTING the info saying milk is not available anymore and if you need any help tell me...!!-There are 3 elevators but for some reason you wait 20 mins if not more to get it, we guessed it s because the cleaning staff kept pressing it to move from floor to floor.-They charge you 5usd extra to clean your room or they ask you to put the do not disturb card on the door so they don't get in to clean. On the day we checked out they charged us 5usd cleaning, than i asked them what is it for and without any explanation they simply said:"" Oh don't worry we will remove that for you"".

485,"I recently stayed at this hotel because of reading the wonderful reviews. Also, Hotels.com had a fantastic rate. I regret ever choosing this place. It was so bad that I had to make a list:Here goes:We reserved a Studio Suite with 1 King bed. To call this a suite is laughable at best. This room was so tiny that you could consider a stay at Motel 6 a suite. There is NOTHING that I could see that would make this a suite except say the ""kitchen"" which was a flat top 2 burner with a sink and fridge as well as a microwave.When we checked in it was a bit of a wait. I didn't mind this because I felt that meant that the location was popular. We asked for a lower room and that was accommodated. When we tried to use the elevators they were frequently on the upper floors exclusively and the wait was outrageously long. By the time you got an elevator it was frequently stuffed with people so you had to wait even longer. So we opted to just carry our luggage up the stairs.When I entered the room I discovered that it was decorated with peeling wall paper and there were stains on it! No biggie, but after a long travel day we decided to just relax a few minutes. So I turned on the TV in the room. Let me tell you this is NO EXAGGERATION, we got FOUR CHANNELS. That's it!! FOUR CHANNELS. The rest either were fuzzy or said no signal. Again, I wasn't going to complain so figured I would access the internet and watch something on my iPad, the wi-fi wouldn't connect!So down to the front desk I went. I was told that they would send someone to check on the room. Great! Fantastic!! But nothing changed. We found that throughout our stay we were told on THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS that the internet and tv would be fixed..it NEVER WAS. They didn't even come to the room at all to talk to us. The only evidence we had of anybody coming was while we were gone. We returned from one of our outings and found that the TV was on and there were snippets of wires on our table. Great job cleaning up. After complaining AGAIN they opted to give us a late check out. Not really an issue for us but we took it (check out at 1230 rather than 11). Other issues:ANYTIME you used ANYTHING water related in the room a loud squealing would come from the bathroom (I recorded this on my phone). It would sometimes go on for SEVERAL MINUTES and was maddening. Next, location. Is it close to Times Square, Yes. However, with some drawbacks. There is a liquor store about 3 buildings down on the same side of the street as the hotel. You have to walk by this to get to Times Square on foot. Our first day we walked by and about witnessed a fight. It is frequented by drunks and undesirable characters that beg for money or fight/argue amongst each other. We found that we would frequently try to cross the street before coming to that spot but found same issue on the opposite side, we finally just started using cabs. Now for the view, the reason you come to NYC. Our view was of a wonderful canopy of the building next door! It was COVERED with dirty diapers and garbage. This also littered the area just outside of our room. So that was another strike.When we were walking on the floor we were staying on it had the feel of a run down apartment complex. They also encourage smoking in front of the main entrance doors so you constantly get to enjoy the smell of smoke.It wasn't all COMPLETELY bad. The complimentary breakfast was decent. However, be prepared to eat in your room because there is NO seating. The area you dine in is extremely SMALL!!All in all, YMMV in this location, as I have seen several positive reviews as well. Would I ever stay there again?? DEFINITELY NOT!!I feel that the staff doesn't particularly care about issues. Especially when it comes to room issues. To complain 3 times and not have anything fixed is ridiculous. The solution for the issues? They offered us 20% refund (comical) or 20,000 points for a program we were not in to begin with. Oh and as I said earlier, I was given a LATE checkout by the front desk. At almost EXACTLY 1100 there comes a knock on the door. I was met by a rather rude female worker asking, ""when are you leaving"". I looked at her and said I was given a late checkout and she just walked away. Unbelievable. So do yourself a favor, pay a little more and get a better option.","January 5, 2019","8    Staybridge Suites Times Square - New York City

486,"I stayed here for one night with my family in mid-June and will not go back. My kids (6 & 3) were traumatized when the smoke alarm in our room went off in the middle of the night while we were sleeping causing us to escape our room (we thought it was the hotel fire alarm). The night manager was unapologetic to the situation and offered us a facilities fee refund for the defective smoke alarm. We ended up changing rooms. Finally the day manager refunded the entire room. Additionally I had a pair of sunglasses that was given to them for their lost and found. However despite repeated calls as well as talking to the front desk in person, I am unable to get them since their maintenance manager (who apparently is the only person to have access to the lost and found) is never present. I left my address and phone number so that they can send them back to me but I doubt I will ever get them.","July 11, 2019","9    Stewart Hotel

487,"I have been staying at this property since I was a young teenager. Then, it was called the Southgate hotel. It was old and a bit dark, but spacious - a rare and sought-after amenity in NYC. In recent years, the hotel was Affinia Manhattan - under this management, the hotel undertook a major renovation, modernizing the rooms and brightening up the place. It made staying here even better. Most recently, the hotel has become The Stewart Hotel. The rooms appear to have been converted from apartments at some point - as they vary in size. Many of the rooms have a full kitchen and some are quite spacious. When I traveled with 13 girl scouts and 5 chaperones to NYC in June, one of the suites was big enough to accommodate 5 girls in the living room alone - with a fairly large king bedroom for two of the chaperones. I just returned today from a mother-daughter NYC getaway with my 13-year old. It was a trip to expose her to all of the greatness, art, and diversity of NYC. We booked the breakfast package - which included vouchers for $15 per person at a nearby bagel shop (which was wonderful). The $15 was more than enough to cover breakfast - and even a snack for the rood. When we checked in, I noticed our room was quite small - smaller than any of the rooms I have ever stayed in at this property. Eventually, I checked my reservation and learned we had not been assigned the right room type. I contacted the front desk and Margaret, a truly kind and accommodating front desk guru, was able to remove the amount we paid for an upgrade to an upper floor and the fees associated with our reservation. This made a huge difference!As the US National Women's Soccer Team was coming to NYC for a World Cup victory parade the day we were originally slated to leave, Andrew, the front desk manager (who was working from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.), worked with me to extend our stay so my soccer-loving daughter and I could go to the parade. We paid more than we would have liked, but Andrew worked to the best of his ability to make sure it was as affordable as possible. All told - I find the Stewart to be an exceptional place to stay. I don't review many properties - and I only do so when I feel compelled to extol the virtues of a hotel and its staff. The Stewart may not be perfect - or the most modern of hotels - but it is pretty amazing in all of the aspects that count - central location, clean and generous accommodations, and empathetic and kind staff - especially Andrew and Margaret.","July 11, 2019","9    Stewart Hotel

515,"I just stayed here for 2 weeks in a studio with kitchen. The positives are my room was not available for my whole trip but I upgraded my room and they kept me in my same room instead of having to change (not sure how that changed from booking to staying). Niles bar was nice and the barmen were lovely. Go to mustang Harry’s across the road if you get a chance the bar staff are amazing.Amazing proximity to penn station and 34th street path station (to get to Hoboken).Not sure where everyone’s getting these amazing staff from, everyone I spoke to apart from one Asian guy who’s name I didn’t catch made me feel like they wanted to get rid of me. Not great for a young British girl visiting America alone.I had 3 suitcases and was helped up the stairs with them then ignored and nobody helped when I left either.The room itself is very large and very handy to have the kitchen (especially considering how expensive New York is for food) target and whole foods are not far so I cooked pasta and stuff a lot. Be aware if you leave food in the pan (for the next night or something) the cleaner WILL throw it away. She will also throw away any wine you leave out to breathe. And will leave her hairs in the bath (black hairs, not my blond hair) and if you’re not out of your room by midday she will knock, shout, call and try to open the door even if you have a do not disturb sign out. When I first got into the room someone else’s bra was in the drawer next to the bed. I told the front desk and the girl apologised and said it would be sorted but when I got back to my room hours later it was still there and the cleaner said she took it away (god knows what she did take then). My sheets were not changed once in my whole 2 week stay and there was a large red stain on the corner of the duvet, similar to the red coming through the wallpaper (?). I was so surprised that there was no robe or slippers provided and the thing that bugged me the most was the shower curtain (gross) who even uses shower curtains any more? Never ever seen that in a hotel.On about my 3rd day I came down at 4pm and asked if it was too late to have my room serviced and the girl said no they have people cleaning rooms all day so I was shocked when I came down once at 6pm and asked for my room to be serviced and there was a discussion behind the desk and I was told ‘we’ll see what we can do but you might not get a full service’ .. they literally took the bin out and that was it. That’s what I’m paying $3,500 for? In the room description they tell you ‘iHome docking station’ .. it’s for an iPhone 4, not the smaller lightening jack for the iPhones every person has now. The window sills and lamps are very dusty and when I got to my room there was a squashed mosquito on the window sill, and another one appeared that I didn’t squash either? The bed was comfy enough but I literally woke up about 4 times a night because of the air con. The air con, as everyone has said, is extremely loud and has been put through a hole in the window so it literally sounds like there’s a window open and you can hear everything.  A guy I met in a bar told me he stays here quite often for work and he once found a USED condom UNDER the sheets. He wasn’t surprised about the bra situation in my room.I probably would stay here again purely for convenience and one of my friends has booked a stay here, I just will lower my expectations next time.","June 16, 2019","9    Stewart Hotel

Great location, we have walked most places and Penn Station is just across the road.Check in was fast and simple after a long flight from Brisbane/Melbourne. Room as expected a little dated but clean and all we need as we wanted a place to sleep after exploring. Room serviced everyday and couple of requests for minor things have been acted on quickly and with friendliness. Eg additional coat hangers. Really happy with room and price. We also used the washing machine which was great. Restaurant/bar downstairs looks really good. We are yet to try as we have had a list of places to eat.

529,my stay at the Stewart hotel was mixed. I was already skeptical as I found out just before my stay that the reviews on their Tripadvisor website were fake. I travelled with my family and we booked a room with 2 beds for originally 7 nights. after 2 freezing nights of noise we could't bear it and had to change hotels. the rooms did not meet our expectations and were extremely small and cramped. you felt like you were in a cold dungeon. the decor was tired and old and overall the rooms bought my stay down for me. as we stayed during Christmas time I did enjoy the decorations in the lobby but there was vents that came from outside straight into each bedroom which let out the constant noise of loud sirens and nightlife as well as the freezing cold air. it was like they had just done a cheap and bad renovation to the rooms. my family and I did not sleep for 2 nights and it felt like we were sleeping on the streets. therefore we changed hotels.,"June 5, 2019","9    Stewart Hotel

The Stewart hotel is around a 20 minute walk from time square and 30 from the Empire State Building. In a busy city you don’t need to hire a car just walk.

540,"You can't go wrong with the location of this place, 5-10 mins walk to Central Park, Time's Square, and all that go with it. Of course the rooms are tiny, but this is New York. My only beef was with the service at the hotel, no one really wanted to offer any service, or if you asked it felt like you were making them do something they didn't want to do. If you have any questions, or need some tips, just speak to the guys at the door, they actually helped and offer service, thanks fellas! Bar on the roof is cool, but doesn't open to 4 or 5 pm, what is that? There should be certain hours just for guest before corp parties come or the after work crowd. Diner across the street is good, along with the .99$ pizza place next to it. With proper service this could be a great hotel, until then 2-3 stars. 85$ resort fee also added at checkout, with no resort perks.","July 12, 2019","10    Dream Midtown

542,"We arrived to the hotel on a Friday morning, several hours before check in, and not only did they have a room ready for us, but we were given a complimentary upgrade! This was a great start to our trip. The room was compact, but generous by NYC standards. The bed was super soft (in a good way) which led to me having one of the best sleeps I've ever had while on vacation. The hotel is located in a great area: very close to one of the main subway lines, Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, and many restaurants, cars, and cafes. The hotel's cocktail lounge, The Rickey, is a must try!Downside: We were on the 11th floor and could hear the music being blasted from the rooftop bar until very late on Friday & Saturday nights. Although I was very annoyed the first night, I expected/got used to it by the second night. The other only downside to this hotel is the resort/facility fee. It's nothing more than just a cash grab...nothing extra is offered with it. In fact, our room wasn't even cleaned one of the days we were there.We would definitely stay here again!","July 11, 2019","10    Dream Midtown

543,"This hotel looks amazing in the hotel reception. A really nice, modern feel to it. The room was decorated nicely and was clean. However there were small flys in the bathroom and all around the shower area. We didn’t have a window open so I’m not sure where they came from. When I took the plug out of the sink it was covered in hair. The toilet seat was also wonky and moved when you sat on it. Amenities were fine, but not many. Just shower gel, condition and shampoo - we had a lot more in our hotels in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Daily water which is a nice touch. We stayed Saturday - Tuesday and we could very hear loud music from the hotels bar until 4am in the morning on the Saturday night. Sort of understandable, but 4am is very late! The cleaners were friendly and the room was always cleaned well. We barely saw the other staff of the hotel which felt a bit strange and some of them came across as a bit rude - we didn’t feel very appreciated for staying at their hotel. We also had a really late flight home and they late us check out at 1pm instead of 12 at no extra cost which is nice, but we wanted to get changed and had to walk through the hotels restaurant to use their toilets to do so which were not very clean! Hotel in a great location. Don’t be put off my review and not book, it definitely did the job and was overall clean with a comfy bed which is the main priority!","July 11, 2019","10    Dream Midtown

545,"We live in the tri-state area and occasionally like to stay in the city instead of driving home after a night out. We looked at the ratings for the Dream Midtown and decided to book a room since the location was good and the rate was reasonable. We used the app Hotel Tonight. Upon checking in they gave us what must have been the worst room in the hotel. It was a very small, oddly configured room on the 13th floor that was next to the express elevator to the rooftop bar, The room was also was right below the rooftop bar and just down the hall from the employee lounge where staff members would congregate and create a lot of noise. I defy management to explain how any of their rooms are worse than the one they gave us. We didn’t say anything at first because we planned on being out for the evening and want to see how it was when we returned. Upon our return when we stepped off the elevation on the 13th floor it sounded like the DJ from the Penthouse bar was in our room. The music was coming through the elevator shaft and through the walls and ceiling. It was so incredibly loud! So we went down to reception and told them they we were unable to stay in the room because of all the problems (especially the noise). David, at the front desk, (who was reasonably polite) first said that they were fully booked (which just wasn't true - we went on line and found rooms available). When we repeated that we were not going to stay in that room he went into the room next to reception (presumably to speak with someone) and when he returned he reluctantly gave us a room on the 6th floor away from the elevators (I guess they were not fully booked after all). He asked us how we booked our room and when we said Hotel Tonight he explained that when you book through one of the discount sites the hotel will likely give you “whatever room is available without focusing on the quality of the room"" (we interpreted that to mean the worst room in the hotel).” Even on the 6th floor the music was blaring through the elevator shaft but it was quieter away from the elevator shafts. Our new room was not without issues but they were minor in comparison. If you want to party until 4AM this may be a place to consider. For sleep there are many better alternatives.","July 7, 2019","10    Dream Midtown

549,"I have always stayed at another hotel a block off Times Square, but wanted to save a ton of money and took a gamble on booking two rooms for me and my son at the Dream Midtown. Overall, I was very happy. The location is amazing. Short 5 minute walk to Central Park and short 10 minute stroll to Times Square. Relatively quiet location. Staff are very professional and helpful. Rooms are small and bright and on the modern side. There is a rooftop patio/lounge that was incredibly popular with a line up down the street on Saturday evening. I didn't have a chance to check it out, but the young crowd lined up suggested it was a big hit. No noticeable noise or trouble from those accessing the rooftop lounge. Our rooms were on the 7th floor. Bed was very comfortable 8/10. Bedding was great 8/10. i thought the pillows weren't great 6/10 (they were tiny). Washroom was nice 8/10. Soap was odd - tiny little square that crumbled easily 5/10. TV was great 8/10. View from my room was minimal - but that is par for the course for a smaller building in Manhattan. Room rates were Excellent! I saved a ton staying here. This hotel would have a solid 5 star rating if they fixed one very major problem: noise from the hall (which could come from the hall or from other rooms) because the DOORS DON'T FIT PROPERLY AND ARE TERRIBLE. For what it's worth - I would expect most everyone to give this place a 5 star rating if they changed all of the doors. I figure they could increase the room rates by $10 per night for every room and recover the expense (within 6 months) of a new properly fitting, soundproof door, on every room. $10/night won't scare away any new guest - and this property will be booked up for months to come. I would make sure you do not get a room near the elevator! If you can sleep through anything, then this is not an issue for you. If you bring a loud white noise maker, then you can get by. If you are a very light sleeper - you won't be happy. The doors presently have the same soundproofing as a curtain.Overall, if you are not bothered by hallway noise, this place is a gem. Sorry to be so harsh about the doors. But both of our rooms were exactly the same.","July 2, 2019","10    Dream Midtown

563,"First and foremost, thank you! My time at Dream Midtown was amazing! I came in on business from San Francisco not expecting much from New York in the sense of hospitality. Time to time I hear the people there are rude etc. but I was mistaken! Upon arrival I had the pleasure of meeting Adrian whom was very helpful with my belongings. From there I had met Winard and Gustavo, these gentlemen would be the reason why Dream Midtown will see me again. Gustavo in particular was very kind and informative, as I had mentioned I was a bit leary of New Yorkers but these guys sure proved me wrong. I was given the perfect room, everything I needed and inquired about was granted at the drop of a hat. Dream Midtown enhanced my business trip leaving me with the urge to schedule another one!

565,"I travel to NYC for business every few weeks and tried The Dream in midtown this time. The hotel was basic and fine for the rates though the extremely small room and no real amenities. The room didn’t even have lotion, just shampoo and conditioner and one time shower gel. Room was extremely basic for the price. Another nyc hotel where the lobby is much nicer than the rooms. So you pay more money for the nice lobby with loud music that you are never in.What will make me not stay at this hotel again though as it is part of a growing trend of hotels charging a resort or facilities fee for NOTHING, just because they feel they can because other hotels started to. In this case, they charged a $25/night resort fee per night and told me it was for the gym - a gym they didn’t even have, they give passes to a dirty Crunch gym a few blocks away - And WiFi, basic services that even if they had other hotels in the area offer with NO resort fee (including the Cassa and Park Terrace).What’s more, another hotel (like The Royalton) that doesn’t even offer coffee in the morning anywhere or even a coffee maker in the room. Instead, they direct you to a Starbucks a few blocks away.I feel totally ripped off by the resort fee and will not stay there again, nor will I stay at any hotel who continues to rip customers off by charging these fees for nothing. I suggest you call ahead and make sure any hotel you stay in does not charge these fees as there are plenty of hotels that still don’t charge them and have nicer facilities, actual gyms in the hotel, and coffee - something even a basic La Quinta Inn or Courtyard Marriott has anywhere else.Of course because the customer service is generally bad in NYC the front desk didn’t care when I lodged this complaint. I definitely won’t stay at The Dream again until they do some basic upgrades and remove the resort fee. It seems to only pay for the fish tank in the lobby.","June 7, 2019","10    Dream Midtown

577,"What a difference a day makes. Yesterday, I wrote a critical review of our experience here, but after an incredible response from DREAM Midtown, I am writing an updated assessment.Our stay unfortunately started off poorly, mostly due to noise-related issues in our first-floor room. However, after discussing our concerns with the night manager (whose name escapes me now), when we woke up this morning, plans were already underway to move us to a larger, quieter room on a higher floor. Not only that, but when I met with the day manager, Michael, he further provided complimentary breakfasts, wine, and a discount. Michael also continued following up with us through the day to ensure that the issues we had experienced were rectified. I cannot remember a time when an individual has done so much to help turn around what would have otherwise been a bad experience. DREAM Midtown is exceptionally fortunate to have someone with Michael's genuine courtesy and commitment to making things right for their guests.We will certainly consider staying at DREAM Midtown again next time we visit New York, and encourage others to as well - the customer service alone warrants taking a look. Be sure, though, to avoid first floor rooms unless you are a partier or heavy sleeper!","May 26, 2019","10    Dream Midtown

Modern bathroom, consisting of a walk-in shower sink and wc. The room could have maybe done with a bit of freshening up but was clean. One small wardrobe that was just the right size for what we wanted to store ( clothes for 5 days ) .Soundproofing of noise from the outside was not good but I understand that this is quite usual when staying in New York.

There are several subway train stations within a few blocks. The property is clean and quiet. All of the employees were friendly and willing to help in anyway. The lobby staff always had a joke or riddle for our kids anytime we entered the lobby. We chose a room on the back of the hotel near 48th Avenue and had a small view of Times Square. Our room was a two queen deluxe and included breakfast each morning. Seems that double queen beds are hard to come by in NYC. We had a microwave, mini refrigerator, Keurig coffeemaker, 42” tv, desk and chair with WiFi that worked excellent. The room was always clean and bath items restocked when we returned from the days adventures. The breakfast area is clean and inviting. Breakfast consists of grab and go type items. It is not the usual continental type you may be accustomed too. Sometimes the choices were limited, but it worked well and the items were hot, fresh, and tasty. We used the hotel pantry to purchase some food items. Be aware, the prices are kinda high. Soft drink machines are available, in the hotel, and the prices are about half of those in the pantry. I would recommend Hilton Garden Inn Times Square to anyone that is looking for a hotel that has everything and is in a great location. We would certainly stay here again if we return to NYC.

604,"I booked this on Hilton Honors points - perhaps that's why my experience was what it was.First the good:1) Within easy walks to subway stations going anywhere2) Charles the doorman was excellent3) Within tolerable walks (given 90 degree heat) of a number of points of interest4) Air conditioning worked flawlessly!5) Quiet6) Elevators were reasonably responsive - no long waits for up to 15 floors.Disappointments:1) I am accustomed to having HGI's have their own restaurant with reasonably good food. This one had apparently done a deal with a local coffee company and the breakfasts were mindful of something one would pick up at McDonalds, only not that good. The highlight of the week there was when people didn't show up to staff breakfast and we got a freebie at the Times Square Diner and Grill across the street.2) Room cleaning was spotty. Sometimes the room was pristine when we got back; other times there was stuff from the day before that had not been cleaned out.3) The immediate area is just plain ugly; lots of scaffolding and construction. 4) There were times (principally early evenings, when getting an answer at the front desk was pretty hard.5) Getting a taxi on 8th avenue is pretty hard - if the doorman offers you a car service to the airport, TAKE IT. It is more expensive, but it is worth every penny.","July 3, 2019","11    Hilton Garden Inn Times Square

606,"Excellent location to walk to Broadway shows, Times Square and very close to a subway stop. Location was the best thing about this hotel. Front desk staff were civil at check in, not warm nor welcoming. The person who checked us in was Adobya ( spelling?) a woman with dark hair and glasses. When I asked about complimentary breakfast as a Diamond member. She asked incredulously “You want breakfast instead of points?” We thought it strange at the time but found out the next morning. We are used to a cooked breakfast at every Hilton Garden Inn we have ever stayed. This hotel does not have a restaurant. There is one person behind a counter that will give you either a microwaved breakfast sandwich OR a pastry OR a waffle OR cereal. You are given breakfast coupons and you circle which option you want. You can also choose between 1 piece of fruit and either orange juice OR milk and Coffee or tea. There are about 6 choices of hot microwaved sandwiches on the coupon but each of the 3 mornings only 2-3 were actually available. If breakfast is important to you then you should stay at the Hampton Inn a block away. When we arrived our room was not ready. The hotel held our luggage and said that they would call us as soon as our room was ready. We never got a call. We returned to the hotel at 3 pm. The front desk was flippant with an “ oh sorry” that they did not call us as they promised. The hotel staff and breakfast does not match up to the standard at other Hilton Garden Inns","July 2, 2019","11    Hilton Garden Inn Times Square

In all my years, I have never been in any HGI where you are served a garbage, pre-made sandwich and a small coffee...with NO REFILLS. While the location is cool, access and parking are a nightmare. Parking is $64 per DAY. The only shining star was Donald, the valet who provided excellent service, a friendly demeanor and attentive to helping us navigate this mess.

609,"I have booked a family room at your hotel through Booking.com eight months in advance for my family's summer holidays in NYC in late June. I had reconfirmed directly with Booking just few days before my traveling through email and I had the obligation to pay directly to the hotel at my arrival there. But when we arrived, we were informed by the manager that our reservation was cancelled few hours before our arrival when we were on the plane to NYC. She claimed that they tried to check my credit card and they found it invalid and because of this, according to hotel's policy, they cancelled my reservation and sold my room to other customers. I explained to the manager Mrs Alexandra Franklin that this was a mistake, because my credit card was valid. Moreover, nobody had informed me for the cancellation in order to have the opportunity to react. I was standing at the hotel's lobby with my family after 15 hours of travelling through two different flights, we were all exhausted, especially my children and we asked Mrs Frankin to help us to find a solution. She was totally rude, sarcastic, and she did not try at all to suggest an alternative proposal. Probably found the situation fun because she was constantly laughing. My family and I have been shocked by both the unjustified cancellation of our reservation and the unpredictable behavior of this employee. With no excuse, the management oh your hotel according to LAST MINUTE CANCELLATION POLICY destroyed my family's holidays, which were scheduled eight months ago. For this reason I will make this event known everywhere for everyone to know the unbelievable way you treat your customers !!!!!!","July 1, 2019","11    Hilton Garden Inn Times Square

The room has a Keurig, a refrigerator, and a microwave, so if you on a budget, this helps. Nearby is Lilly's Victorian (great for lunch/high tea) and Patzeria Pizza (good pizza/italian). The area felt safe for walking back after a show. The staff was very friendly and it was very easy to make transportation arrangements back to the airport. I would stay here again without hesitation.

After we all searched the room for a few minutes, we were beginning to think the worst (they were stolen) when we heard a knock at our door. The manager of the hotel stood there with my son’s broken headphones, a brand new pair of the exact same headphonesand a handwritten note apologizing for them accidentally getting broken by a member of the housekeeping team. This went above and beyond for the hotel manager to do this and I was very impressed and humbled.

The room was very clean and spacious for NYC. Very impressed. Was not a fan of the grab and go breakfast at all. The egg and turkey sausage on a muffin was not good.

620,"We have stayed at the hotel in the past when attending a Broadway play and have always been more than satisfied with our experience. This time was different. We reserved an upgraded corner king room which was very nice. However, on the first night the toilet leaked at the connections between the bowl and tank so water was all over the floor. In addition, the first flush caused the toilet to come within an inch of overflowing. At 5:30 am I went to the lobby and asked for another room. I was given a standard king room, a downgrade from the room I reserved but was happy to get another room. I asked at the bell stand if I could use a luggage cart to move our clothes and luggage. I was told guests were not permitted to use the carts - so instead of one trip to the new room it was four trips.Later that day I talked to a manager about a room rate reduction for the new room. She told me she would take care of that plus give me 10,000 points for my trouble. A week later the points have not been added to my account. When we checked out I found that the downgraded room cost me $33 per night plus tax more than my original rate. I talked to the same manager and she was confused but assured me the rate was correct. I had to leave for the airport so I let it go. Later I talked to the night manager and she was terrific. She asked me to send her a copy of the original rate I booked and she would take care of it. She did and the credit has been applied to my account - but still not the points. I am thankful that there is one person in the hotel that cares about their customers.This hotel, at one time, had a nice French bistro attached to the lobby. It is no longer there and has been replaced by ""canteen"" staffed to provide coffee and pastries, etc. It is a pretty sorry excuse for a dining room.

Rather than kindly explain anything, you get a less than courteous ‘HOLD ON’ and transfer to Hilton. Twice that happened and I finally gave up talking to these folks. Listen here is the best advise I can give any company - customer service first impressions are extremely important and set the stage for what’s to come. If you can’t deliver good service and talk nicely to people, deliver trash instead so you can talk to the garbage all you want and how you want to because you don’t deserve being the Ambassador of such an iconic brand.

I absolutely LOVE this hotel. The location, the cleanliness, the extremely helpful employees - and also the BEST valet/concierge team EVER! Charles is FANTASTIC and so friendly! Jules is a blast! These guys took such great care of me while I was there and I had several laughs with them while waiting for my car service. They were always there (both stays) to greet me as I walked back in and took care of my baggage after I checked out and had to attend meetings. I can not say enough about this great place and incredible team. Charles, I don’t know your last name to thank you personally but look forward to another great trip to the Big Apple!","May 30, 2019","11    Hilton Garden Inn Times Square

644,"We have been bringing our daughter to NYC to see shows and plays since she was 6 years old. (She is 15 now) We often stay at the Hilton Garden Inn on 8th Ave because it is a perfect walk to both Central Park and the Theatre District. One of the highlights of our trip is always the doorman, Charles. He called my daughter Princess the very first time we stayed here and still does every time we see him. He is always helpful, and makes my daughter and us laugh. He is a true delight and really one of the reasons we keep coming back. The hotel is wonderful, clean, and easy to get too.","May 27, 2019","11    Hilton Garden Inn Times Square

And could not get through for 2 hours and when i finally got through to the hotel. The gentleman who answered the phone was very rude and then before i can finish giving him my information he transferred me to another phone and that kept ringing. I called again and it was ringing again. And got the same gentleman and i asked to speak to a manage very politely he said what do you want?! In a nasty voice. So when i arrive at the hotel this afternoon to check in i do hope this gentleman will be there so i can file a complaint on his rudeness.,"May 24, 2019","11    Hilton Garden Inn Times Square

We got bottles of water every day for no extra charge and the AC worked perfectly. The location was ideal as we took the subway to many places or walked and had no issues. What made this hotel feel like home were the kind and helpful staff. If you meet Michael, who works there, he is the best!!! He helped us get around, gave us outstanding recommendations, arranged a car for us to get back to LaGuardia, and made us feel so welcome. We did not want to leave.

652,"I have previously frequented the Martinique with no issues (when it was still part of the Radisson group). Booked a Queen room for a week and was highly disappointed with the stay this time.PROS: Location CONS: …The Hotel is now part of the Hilton Group, I was very shocked to discover that rates for this hotel are drastically cheaper on third party websites compared to the Hilton Honors website, sadly it seems for a major chain, that Hilton does not offer a guarantee on best prices when booking directly with them. …The room was extremely small and the bed took up almost the entire space in the room, making it quiet claustrophobic, especially if you have to spend more time in, or for a longer stay. … There is no closet, just a small rail with a few hangers with a tiny space to accommodate the ironing board and iron, no proper place for luggage, which had to be kept on the very little floor space, making in inconvenient to even walk around the bed.… The bathroom was like the size of a small closet, the toilet was literally right next to the door separating it from the bedroom and you had to get into the bathroom and close the door to create a bit of space to be able to get to the shower, basin or toilet, this could be a problem for someone that is more than average in size.… Overall this room can barely accommodate 1 guest with luggage so definitely not suitable for 2.… Room does not come standard with a fridge and the hotel does not provide a microwave on request even for long stays.…Hotel lobby undergoing renovations which is not mentioned when booking, as such the Reception desk is operating right at the entrance and this area gets hectic during check-in and out times, especially when staying guests need to enter or exit the hotel....Hotel also does not have a Business Centre anymore. Definitely not worth the price point for me.","July 10, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

The location of the Martinique is extremely convenient to anything you want to do while in the city. A quick two block walk from Penn Station and a subway station right outside the hotel on the corner. It was great to be a bit away from the noisy and bustling Times Square area and yet still be within walking distance to see a play.

658,"This old and somewhat traditional establishment is now part of Hilton, and it therefore bears some level of homogenisation that is inevitable with a chain. The rooms are comfortable, and even though there were refurbishing works around the main entrance, one can sense that this is an elegant structure. As it has become the norm, booking.com messed up with the reservation: instead of a room with two beds they got us a room with a king bed. The staff at Hilton dealt with this hiccup quite well I have to say and our stay was smooth. I was told that Hilton, among others, matches online prices, so it might become good practice to actually avoid booking.com.On the location, this is really in the heart of Mid-town, few steps away from the Empire State Building, the Fifth Avenue, Bryant Park, and Times Square, plus very easy access to subways. This proximity with so many hot spots comes at a price though as the level of crowd in the streets around the hotel never subsides.","July 6, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

From the check in receptionist who gave me a bottle of water whilst I was feeling dehydrated, to the customer service operator who helped me cut the sleeves from my T-shirt. I was really impressed with the people. That’s often one of the most important things about a hotel stay. Special mention to The Mánager Susan who is very professional and also Candice who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of what to do in NYC (do not miss the chance to ask her for advice). Restaurant staff were wonderful and predicted my order by day 2 (Rosalind). I will definitely return once the renovations are complete and give another review.

That's right, one person. Not only to check in guests but to also deal with the complaints and requests from customers who kept walking up - thinking that they each were more important.Our room, a double, was nice enough. The walls are thin and you can hear people next door, as well as all the morning slamming doors in the hallway.I'm really glad I didn't pay more for the room than I did, otherwise I would be more dissatisfied. The hotel is located about a 20 minute walk from Times Square or about 10 minutes by subway. Not the worst location.It's an older hotel that comes with all the quirks.

666,"Keeping in mind that this hotel is under renovation in the lobby area, we still probably wouldn’t stay again. We are Diamond Members and this was the absolute worst check-in experience ever. There was only 2 employees checking people in with no HHonors separate check-in. They were severely understaffed with about 15 people in line. (A Saturday at 4pm which is prime time in the city) We booked this room as we were sharing with another couple and it’s one of the only hotels in the city you will find 2 queen beds (usually it’s 2 double). Big perk when sharing a room! The room was newly renovated and the decor was very nice. The beds were comfy as well however, the bathroom door is frosted glass so when someone wakes up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, the room lights up so bright. Aesthetically, very nice but not functional. The location is nice being close to penn station if you’re taking mass transit and in the middle of Korea town which had great food. The hotel is old with nice charm however the elevators are small and creepy with a lobby that’s super small and cramped. ","June 24, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

669,"Reception area under renovation with an unwelcoming, rude reception staff. There was a line for check-in. I waited until the last guest had finished checking in when I walked up to the desk. The person at the desk was about 15"" away from me. Instead of greeting me she said ""May I help the next guest"" loudly, to my face aggressively chastising me for walking up before being called. This is not an airline counter, and I'd walked up when I thought it was appropriate just like I would anywhere else in the world. I'd been travelling for the last ten hours and this DID NOT make me feel welcome. In general there was a bad attitude among the reception staff. A lot of eye rolling and a sense that they did not enjoy their job. The doormen and bell staff were friendly and helpful though. The inadequate service continued. The next morning I called room service to ask for a small pot of coffee and milk on the side, something I do every morning that I'm in a hotel with room service, and please note that I spend between 50 and 70 nights a year staying at hotels. The person who picked up the phone at room service asked me if I really wanted to just get coffee like that when I had a coffee maker in the room. I was shocked. No one has ever questioned my decision to get room service coffee from a hotel. I was barely awake and must have sounded stunned when I said, ""Excuse me, what did you say?"" He then said he'd bring up the coffee and milk right up and when he arrived he still had an attitude. ","June 23, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

670,"Hilton really does a good job in revitalizing this former ""Radisson,"" which looked very rundown. The lobby is currently under renovations and I am sure it will look great when it is reopened during the summer. Unlike other Hiltons, the bell staffs were great and extremely helpful. I arrived around 12:30pm and the agent was able to give me a room. The room itself is typical New York size so I have already booked myself a room with King size sofa (and once again, there is no upgrade despite my Diamond status, which is sort of the norm these days). Because of the historical building, the window is on the small side but given how busy 32nd street is, it might not be a bad idea. I also like the high ceiling. The bathroom is fine and the shower pressure is great. There is a full array of amenities including body wash/gel, so it passes my personal test of being in a good hotel. The only problem is the strange a/c unit and also the relatively slow WIFI. I have a week long stay booked here in late August and as of now, I am sort of torn because of the WIFI situation. One of pro and perhaps con is the location. It is located right at Korean-town, which means 24 hours food and subway stop right at your doorstep. Penn Station is a full block away and there are plenty of CVS, shoppings and banks within ten blocks. There is plenty to do, but at the same time, this stretch can also be noisy especially in the weekends. There are plenty of bars and Korean drinking lounges/Karaoke bars, so expect some noises in the weekend. You might want to pay for a higher floor if you are sensitive to noise. In conclusion, I enjoy my stay here and can't wait to see what the new lobby will look like. Hopefully I can get a reply here regarding the WIFI situation and if there is plan to speed it up or at least provide a premium high speed option.","June 20, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

685,"I have been in NYC for a few months so far for work. I found the Matinique to be convenient enough to both work and some interesting restaurants. It's generally quiet, with plenty of rooms, a usually empty enough fitness center, and a pretty decent breakfast buffet (though I admittedly eat for free with status, definitely not worth $30/pp but few breakfasts are). All this said, I'm definitely reconsidering my options on where to stay as honestly, the staff doesn't seem to fit the experience that the Martinique is trying to make. The first incident happened in mid-April, when I had a letter delivered at the hotel. Not only was I not notified of it's arrival (not a huge deal courtesy of tracking numbers) but the hotel was unable to provide me with said letter. Seriously. I went to the front desk to inquire about it, they called to the mail room, who confirmed it would be right up. 30 minutes later, still no letter. Not a good look. The second incident occurred today, in June. I ordered takeout, because it's healthier than french cuisine (what's offered in house). I was not provided with a fork. When I called down, I was told they wouldn't bring me a fork because they don't really do that. So, for the rates they're charging v. other Hilton properties in the vicinity, I'll need to take a hard look at the experience I'm getting.","June 4, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

686,"Just returned from a week in NYC on business, and the Martinique was a fabulous location. One block from Penn Station, right off of Herald Square. The room was adequate - on one of the penthouse floors, which gave you access to a lovely lounge. The bed was comfortable, the television large, but there's no comfy reading chair in the room, although there's more than enough space, and the full-length mirror was one of the least flattering I've ever seen. Several light bulbs were out, which speaks to their haphazard eye towards the fine details, but overall, I had a good stay in a reasonably priced (for New York) and reasonably comfortable room.","June 4, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

687,"Just a little over a block from Penn Station, at the corner of Broadway at 32nd St. It was very convenient. The room as quiet. The hotel is the home of the PGA when it started in 1916 and they have some nice mementos displayed on the 2nd Floor. The cost was reasonable for NY (about $230), so I am not sure why people had comments about the cost. If you are taking the train to NYC and will be arriving/leaving from Penn Station, this is very convenient.","June 3, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

689,"Hotel was 'okay' but hindered somewhat by internal and external refurbishment (although this couldn't be helped and I wouldn't mark them down for this). Major disappointment was upfront charge to credit card (not a pre-authorisation, an actual charge) of $50 per room per night which is not highlighted anywhere. My wife questioned this on check in and she was told that 'it's all over the website', implying that it was our own fault for not noticing this. With my wife working in travel we were both confident that this wasn't the case. Once we had settled in we decided to check both the booking website and the hotel website, if it is on either of these then it appears to be very well hidden. While we are aware (and are comfortable) that almost all hotels now require a swipe of a CC for pre-authorisation in the event of using a mini-bar (although not actually present in the rooms here) etc it would be advisable to let customers know that it is hotel policy to actually charge you for this as standard when you check in. Although they advise that the transaction will be cancelled upon check out (and indeed the charge never left a 'pending' state) it is not a great start to your trip when you could potentially already be reducing the available amount you have budgeted for with this charge. Upon checkout we were again told that you're advised of the charge when booking and that proof had been printed off to show us (but had been conveniently 'misplaced'). When my wife pointed out that it is not on any website and certainly not in any of the Important Information sections we were again treated with some disdain on the matter.Anyway, to actually review the hotel.Rooms were big enough for us and, even on the 4th floor, were quiet. They were furnished to a nice standard, had a generous size TV (who doesn't want one of those?!) and had a bathroom with good water pressure from the shower and at a good temperature. One criticism of the room would be the significant lack of storage space for two people staying more than one night.Coffee machine in the room wasn't anything special though and there was a lot of wastage in the packs provided (sweetener, sugar, creamer etc). Loose items would have been better, as would liquid milk instead of creamer powder. Water bottles in the room was a nice touch as were the bathroom toiletries provided. The replenishment of the water and hot drink provisions was erratic though, of the 4 nights we stayed there wasn't a single day where everything was replenished in full.Lifts were frequent and there never seemed to be a long wait which can sometimes be the case. Also very quick so no long uncomfortable journeys either up or down.Doormen were helpful and extremely friendly. Desk staff much less so (expected greater lever of customer service and more empathy instead of blaming us for their errors and lack of willingness to rectify poor first impression).Location was excellent. Right in the shadow of Empire State building and with easy access to subway stations (and Penn Station). Not too far of a walk from a lot of the main tourist areas and plenty of options nearby for food (if you're unsure of where to eat if you haven't been to NYC before)Wifi was complimentary and we didn't have any issues connecting any of the devices we had so that's also a big plus, also seemed to be good connectivity throughout the hotel and in our room.Didn't notice any complimentary services elsewhere in the hotel (such as coffee urns etc in the lobby) which is something we've seen in every other hotel we've stayed in in NYC, although we may have just been lucky on previous trips.Overall, if you're travelling quite light and aren't too bothered about the complimentary amenities (and obviously the CC charge) that are pretty much standard elsewhere then this is a decent enough hotel. Would probably be best suited for business travellers who want wifi access and a pleasant room. However, if it's important to you that your hotel is an important part of your trip then I would say that it's not hugely suited to tourists at this moment (with the exception of the location which is, again, fantastic).In summary - an average hotel with average service that we personally wouldn't stay at again due to what we experienced on this trip.","May 30, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

The AC unit was noisy as it clicked loudly on and off but there was no noise from other rooms. The biggest negative is the current remodeling, which makes the lobby cramped and often noisy. In addition the exterior is being redone, so the hotel is surrounded by scaffolding. The front desk staff and bellmen were very helpful. The restaurant seemed expensive and food only average, in the opinion of my family.We liked the location near the 34th Street subway.

The staff were fantastic, they couldn’t do enough for you and were all extremely polite - especially the door staff, who ensured the door was open when walking in and out with a pram.We are in our 20’s and have a 1 year old and this hotel was perfect for us travelling with a baby. We stayed in a suite, so our daughter was able to roam free round the living space and we could enjoy our own company after putting her to I bed.Bed was extremely comfy and room facilities were fantastic, plus very clean.This is our 6th time in NYC but our first at this particular hotel and we would definitely return.Couldn’t recommend more!","May 28, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

694,"I usually stay close by at one of the Hilton garden Inns, which are pleasant, functional, and fine. but they do lack any real unique character. That's not a criticism just a reality. I got to stay at this property memorial day weekend, the price was fair and I thought I would try something new. was very impressed with the new rooms, the staff was very nice and it was nice to stay in a place that had some character. Clearly older and renovated, the rooms were new. the bathrooms modern and clean(although mine did not drain that well. Beds comfortable, lots of plugs. My room as a double because I did not want to sit for a king, so it was small. If you are at all claustrophobic, hold out for the larger room. It remind me of the palmer house in chicago. But for a short stay I had no issues, but I think more than two nights and I would have wanted something bigger.But overall very nice, peasant, and different, which made it even nicer.And for those who do not go to NYC much, the location is great.

696,"I'm a Hilton Diamond member, and spent quite a bit of time calling many of the Hilton properties in NYC looking for a few particular needs that we had on this trip:1) No resort fee - this is my pet peeve. Just in principal, I won't stay at any hotels that charge them2) didn't mind two adults and two kids staying in the same room3) would offer a 4:00pm checkout on our last day. This is hard to get in NYC. The front desk didn't even hesitate. It was so nice not to have a NYC hotel say something like ""it's $25/hour for each 30 minutes of check-out time after noon"", which is what most of them told me.I just had the feeling here that anything I asked for here wasn't a problem. Everyone was friendly and just wanted to help. Even the Diamond breakfast was a REAL breakfast - not something limited and watered-down like most Hiltons do.We're scheduled to be in NYC three more times this year, and I won't even bother looking for anywhere different this time. In this day of rude flight crews, cramped airline seats, and hotels that want to skimp on every benefit that they offer guests, it was refreshing to be treated like a human being at the Martinique. Rooms here aren't anything fancy, but I'm at the point in my travels where all I need is a good mattress, a clean room, and to be treated right.They're in the middle of what appeared to be a pretty big renovation, so the lobby was crowded and the breakfast room seemed to be setup in a temporary banquet room.

708,"Great stay at the hotel with my girlfriend. Staff were very friendly and no issues with the room. Would highly recommend for anyone wanting to be close to Times Square but not in Times Square. Would say it is about a 12 minute walk to Times Square and just steps away from the Empire State Building. We were able to walk to Central Park in about 30 minutes and the subway station was right outside the hotel. Due to the Canadian dollar being poor, the hotel was a little on the pricier side but pretty consistent with all other New York hotel prices, and on the lower end. Would definitely recommend this hotel.","May 14, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

713,"My wife and I stayed four nights in April 2019. The hotel is conveniently located and was clean and comfortable. It was under major construction but the works were disguised very well. The porters were cheerful and competent and except for one incident the reception team were pleasant and efficient. This was my first visit to New York and on one night I needed to obtain tickets to a music club so I visited the concierge to obtain assistance. The concierge desk was vacant and after enquiring, it was established that the concierge had sneaked off duty early and without telling anyone. I attended reception for help but was faced with a receptionist who was miserable and utterly determined not to assist and I was left to fend for myself. This incident somewhat spoiled an otherwise pleasant stay in pleasant hotel.","May 11, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

The hotel is located right near the subway so it makes it so easy to get where you need to go.The room was immaculate. So fresh and clean. The bathroom was gorgeous. Beds were a tad bit hard but still very comfy. You couldnt hear the city noise, so it was a very quiet stay. There was a lounge room in the 17th floor with granola bars, tea, coffee and other assorted drinks. There was board games you could play. After checkout we check our bags in for about 2 hours so we could get some breakfast before heading home. Michael and Raul who handled our bags were super friendly.

725,"What a lovely hotel! I love historic hotels, and this one balances history with modern, functional updates. Pros: nice-sized room, large bathroom by NY standards, courteous staff, great location, newly renovated, great breakfastCons: no premium WiFi for Diamond, a quasi-lounge, tiny lobbyThis is one of those hotels where every room almost has a unique floor plan, so I was hesitant to check in before arrival. I also hoped for an upgrade. Ironically, the Hilton app showed that I had been “upgraded” to the same type of room I booked. I called the hotel, and they did confirm that the hotel was booked and that no upgrades were available. It would have been great to have a suite, but no big deal because my room was lovely. It was a nice size, functional, mostly spotless, and quiet. The bedding was great. There was a fridge. My water bottles were replenished a few times during the stay. The lighting was nice and well-planned. There was a fridge, and the AC unit worked well and operated at a reasonable volume that actually helped block some of the sound from the street. Since my room was down a secluded hall, it was exceptionally quiet, and I appreciated that given the age of the hotel. The shower was great with good water pressure, and there was lots of storage. The only downside was some grime in lesser-used spots in the restroom since as on top of the towel rack and toilet paper holder. Minor, but noticeable. Otherwise, very clean except the day housekeeping left a bag of trash on my councilor. Honest mistake. I had checked in on the app, but I stopped by the front desk at check in to get a key and learn about the hotel amenities. I was welcomed warmly as a Diamond member, but I had to ask about Diamond benefits and how the work at this hotel. She explained about breakfast, but she did not mention the lounge at all. Although I would not call it a lounge. There are soft drinks, an instant coffee machine, and granola bars. It was all replenished once during my four day stay, and the lounge is accessible to anyone. I did appreciate that it was a large area with lots of seating. I am not sure if this is a published benefit, but if it is, it needs more attention and definitely needs to be brought to the attention of the appropriate Honors members for use. Sustainability: There was a recycle bin in the room, but the hotel does not seem to encourage reusing towels. I had they hung up each day, and they were replaced.There is an attached French restaurant that provides room service, but I did not eat there. I did have breakfast one morning. For Diamond, the full buffet is complimentary, and it is very impressive given the shift of so many hotels to free “continental” breakfast for Diamonds! It was delicious, but I would not have paid the $33 regular cost with so many restaurants close by. Good options for all dietary needs. The lobby is currently under renovation, and there is essentially no space there to gather. The exterior of the hotel is also covered with mesh tarp for renovation; I look forward to seeing the finished product. There are two sets of elevators, and they worked efficiently. If you do have concerns about noise, you might request a room away from elevators. The location is phenomenal near Harold Sq at the intersections of Broadway, 6th, and 32nd. The train station entrance is outside the door of the hotel and provides access to many lines, or you can walk to so many things including Times Sq. A new Ess-a-bagel just opened a block away, and it’s a great place to grab a bagel or black and white cookie!I am not sure if the WiFi system hasn’t been fully converted over to the Hilton system, but there was only one network. Diamonds should get premium WiFi, but I found the one network to be perfectly adequate for browsing and streaming. I will def add this to my list of go-to hotels in NYC.

726,"By the time we reached the hustle and bustle of NYC after our trans-atlantic flight we were feeling a mixture of excitement and tiredness.The cab from JFK took us to the hotel door and although we were a little early for check-in the room was ready.The lobby was quite busy, but we were efficiently and pleasantly checked-in. Loved the old-fashioned elevators and the room was an oasis of calm.Much bigger than we expected, it was cool, dark (curtains were drawn) and radio was tuned to a classical station... ah peace at last! Closer inspection revealed a clean room and bathroom with a comfortable, generously sized bed.We took a short walk around the block and returned to the hotel where it seems standard practice that you have to show your room key to the doorman to gain access (not a problem and I guess it is for security, but not something we have come across before).A good nights sleep and then an excellent breakfast with good old-fashioned service.The location was very central and only a few minutes walk from Penn Station where we caught our train to DC.In summary the hotel has retained some old-world charm and although we did not have time to enjoy all its amenities we were very happy with our stay.","April 22, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

727,"I've now stayed at the Martinique (formerly a Radisson property, now a Curio by Hilton property) several times over the past six months. She's a grand old dame of an earlier era in an incredibly appealing location, close to Penn Station, right on Broadway. Over the past six months, I've developed the following impressions:* Rooms vary wildly, some are truly lovely while some are unrenovated and crappy* Scaffolding facing Broadway (fairly now) is a giant drag* Showers feel modern and pleasant* Room sizes are generally better than most in NYC* Free breakfast for Hilton Diamonds is nice; a club lounge would be nicer* Gym is small for such a large property; weights are in a separate room (which helps)* Lobby is under renovation, and will presumably be lovely sometime soon* Vestibule is staffed 24/7 checking for keys, which is a nice-to-have amenityI always try to get a room in the section to the left of the (temporary) front desk. I've been on the 17th floor in a huge room and just recently, on a crappy third-floor room with endless cacophony from the street below (it's NYC, it happens, but it sucks).Lately, I'm finding better rates here than at the myriad of Hampton and Garden Inn properties around midtown/Chelsea/Penn, and definitely prefer the Martinique.Note: Uber still refers to it as the Radisson Martinique, so be careful.","April 21, 2019","12    Martinique New York on Broadway, Curio Collect...

Literally have to turn in place to get from sink to toilet to shower. (Having said that water pressure was best I ever had in the city. I was giddy) Also, there was almost no where to put unpacked clothes. Also, my husband is a Diamond member. When he called for reservations, he asked for two Queens. They were confirmed by phone then email, but we got two full. We had our two fully grown teenagers, it made for three long nights. Also, sheets were extremely rough, mattresses were hard.

They didn't even ask to hold my luggage (I had a lot of bags) I asked for an upgrade to my room to have extra room. The manager assumed I wouldn't pay for it and immediately said, ""No, we have no upgrades"". I then said, I'll expect to pay for it, do you have a room that's an upgrade to what I'm booked in now. It was almost like he was hoping he didn't have one. Most of where I travel is in Europe (although I'm American) and the service is impeccable.

The room is small and the queen bed is positioned right up against the window but I was traveling solo so that didn't matter. The 42 inch TV was a great treat for a political news junkie such as myself. There's a tiny refrigerator in the room, too! I like a cold beverage or two while enjoying the room and it was nice to be able to store a few bottles of soda and water. Bed was super comfy with luxurious linens. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked with towels and toiletries. Was very happy to see it had a walk in shower. Always hated the tub/shower combo in hotels. Who takes a tub bath when traveling? Nice robes and slippers are provided to slip into after stepping out of the shower.Room service is provided by a service named Hospitality Butler. I ordered breakfast online. Tasty and hot breakfast was quickly delivered within 20 minutes. The coffee left a lot to be desired but I'm a coffee snob so it's probably just me. The room has a Nespresso coffee maker. I prefer regular coffee so didn't use it. A little disappointed there wasn't a drip coffee maker.Parking is available on Gold street about a five minute walk down John street. The hotel will give you a sticker to put on the claim ticket to receive a small discount. Be aware that Gold street is a narrow almost hidden street. I drove past it twice before realizing I had to turn down what I thought was an alley. This hotel will always be at the top of my list of NYC hotels.

741,"What a pleasure to be a guest at this little gem. Away from the hustle of midtown and the throngs of tourists. The hotel is two blocks from the 911 Memorial and a block away from Cortland St subway. Room was spotless , with all the amenities to make for a fab stay. Room was super quiet , very comfortable and the walk in shower excellent! Check in Staff were super friendly and efficient , as was the Concierge.I would highly recommend and will definitely stay here again","June 22, 2019","13    Artezen Hotel

742,"I'm glad I came across this hotel, as it was really good value in a location that was convenient to the main attractions at the southern tip of Manhatten island and with easy connections to the rest of New York. The staff were all friendly and helpful, even telling me to ignore the tornado warning that came on my phone when I checked in. The only issue I had was that the cleaners come round to clean the room a little later in the day compared to other cities I have stayed in, but this was nothing major.","June 16, 2019","13    Artezen Hotel

Everyone working at the hotel was super friendly and welcoming. It’s ideally situated for exploring the city. If we’re ever back in the city (fingers crossed we will be!), we’ll be sure to stay here again. ","June 15, 2019","13    Artezen Hotel

745,"We stayed at The Artezen 6/5-6/6 to celebrate my wifes 60th birthday. Most likely the most pleasant and helpful staff I have ever encountered at any hotel. It started when we went to check in and received an upgrade to a room with a terrace, without asking for one at no extra charge, very nice. As stated everything you need is right there, subway hub, breakfast spot, bar, etc all right across the street. It's a couple of block walk to the Trade Center Memorial, which was beautiful to just sit and reflect early on Thursday morning with coffee. Between seeing a Broadway matinee, dinner at Delmonico's, which also within walking distance albeit a bit further and this hotel it made for a perfect birthday. Again, kudos to the staff especially the girls at the front desk and the the gentleman who who worked the door as well as luggage check, all genuinely down to earth nice people.

I think they are working out some kinks, but their kindness makes up for any bumps. Our room was very clean and comfy. The portable crib we needed was in our room when we arrived and was in perfect condition. It was cool to have Netflix and other streaming available when we chilled in our room after busy days. The patio available with our room was huge and lovely! I visit NYC fairly often but have never stayed in this area. Surely there are pros and cons, but overall we had a wonderful visit due in large part to the comforts of the Artezen Hotel.","June 4, 2019","13    Artezen Hotel

750,"I have stayed at a number hotels in this area before and Artezen is definitely my favourite The staff were welcoming and helpful throughout and the room was light, stylish and super clean. The stand out thing for me was the bed, which was extremely comfortable, but there were also lots of nice little touches throughout that gave the place a sense of luxury e.g. a bottle of water on arrival, an iPad for use in the room, good quality toiletries etc. The shower was excellent and I liked that the desk was slightly removed from the main part of the room: good for keeping work separate from rest. The curtains did a great job at blocking out light, the air con worked well and the room was very quiet - all in all a good recipe for a solid night's sleep. There wasn't a huge amount of storage but there was a small cupboard/wardrobe which was enough for me to hang a few dresses and jackets and there was a room safe for valuables. I didn't use the gym but i could see it was stocked will all the essentials. Being so close to Fulton St station makes this a great location for accessing the rest of the city and there are tons of places to eat close-by (i would recommend Nish Nush for falafel fans!). If you're looking for somewhere with comfort, style and a chilled vibe then look no further.","May 20, 2019","13    Artezen Hotel

752,"Planned a night out during the workweek and decided to stay in the city in lieu of trekking home.Booked a stay in the Artezen Hotel on John Street and was pleasantly surprised by the staff, ambiance, sundries and decor contained in this boutique type property. Upon entering you find a small lobby tastefully decorated and smartly engineered with subdued and comforting lighting. Well mannered front desk staff are most gracious and make your check-in experience effortless and timely. The room I occupied on the 8th floor was thoughtfully designed to make good use of the square footage provided and included a small armoire, desk and chair in addition to a comfortable queen size bed. Above the desk was a wall mounted flat screen TV of good size. On a side of said desk was a coffee/tea maker and 2 bottles of FIJI water. The bathroom was roomy with a good sized walk-in shower and controls that allowed the guest to dial up hot water without restriction (which is something most important to me). The toiletries provided were custom made from CO BIGELOW which was another nice touch akin to the gratis artesian well water. More thoughtfulness as concerns the guest experience is the inclusion of a high quality steamer in lieu of an iron : I was quite impressed how well this apparatus removed wrinkles in addition sanitizing my clothes.I slept like a baby and was happy with the self regulating thermostat provided hence a guest can set a temperature to their liking.","May 17, 2019","13    Artezen Hotel

754,"Stayed recently for a few nights. This is a nice hotel, very clean, modern and convenient to financial district, 9/11 memorial, and subway.Small European-feel hotel with a staff is very friendly and accommodating.A few issues prevent a five-start rating:1. Upon checkin, was told that the roof top deck was not yet open. This should be made clear on the hotel website because this was a selling point for us.2. As another reviewer mentioned, the shower is not intuitive and we, too, were dealing with a cold shower for a few minutes until we figured it out. The rain head is also located too close to the wall to be at all useful.3. The alarm clock went off the first night we were there are 3:30 a.m. Hotel maids should be trained to turn off the alarm clock as part of getting rooms ready between guests.4. The front desk clerk told us that prices will go up soon once people find out about the property. This is NOT how to sell your hotel if you expect return customers or good reviews.","May 13, 2019","13    Artezen Hotel

757,"Stayed here 2 wks ago. approx. Loved everything about it. The proximity to the metro at the Occulus means you can ride the subway with your luggage without transfer from near La Guardia and then take a v. short walk (maybe 5 min.) to the Artezen. The staff has a pleasant and engaging manner to welcome you in. I would like to see a fresh water dispenser in the lobby so I can fill my water bottle instead of receiving one of the small, free non reusable plastic bottles handed out by the doorman. The rooms reminded of some European ones. Max. 6 per floor (makes for quiet) with great floor to ceiling windows. The shower was reminiscent of Europe too.

My check in was quick and easy, the staff was always courteous when I walked through the lobby (thank you Kenneth!), and the hotel itself was perfect. The rooms are brand new, contemporary, clean, and comfortable. Some rooms inevitably don't have a view, but the interior is so beautiful that I would not even mind. The showers and bath products are amazing, and I looked forward to returning to this extra perk each day. The building has no kitchen/cafe or breakfast, but plenty of restaurants nearby. The Fulton Stop is across the street, and can get you anywhere in Manhattan within half an hour.

He went out of his way to make sure we knew all of the spots to hit while traveling in New York. We told him where we wanted to go and he gave us ideas. He really went out of his way to make our trip great. About the room...the room was so nice. Clean and tidy. No issues at all. The hotel is across the street froM an Irish American pub. After looking out our window and seeing its popularity we decided to go there. So fun and convenient since our hotel was right across the street. The front desk employees were so nice.

763,"We initially had a large ADA compliant room on the 4th floor, street side which was good size, but connecting and our neighbors were loud. The front desk was nice enough to move us up to the 16th floor on the backside of the hotel. The room was smaller but I really liked it (1605). I slept so well. It was quiet. We even slept with the windows open. The hotel is brand new, super clean, staff is eager to serve, and the in-room amenities are quite nice. The biggest problem was parking. Initially we were not told that the street was completely torn up in front of the hotel so that we couldn't drop off our bags. Then when we were given information about the parking garage and driving around all the one-way streets, the garage was full. We weren't given the option for another garage as the staff told us when we finally arrived at the hotel. Thankfully, we have the Spothero app. We should have just used this from the beginning.

Ok, I get it, check-in is at 3:00, but I have never been turned away when it was that close to 3:00. And apparently, no room was ready at 2:40. Just odd. ""Go get something to eat and come back"" was what we were told.We came back at 3:20 p.m. and then found out that their key card system had malfunctioned and thus could not provide any keys to anyone. However, they said they would cancel our reservation and find us a new hotel. Really? You couldn't tell me this 45 minutes ago when I was here? No, fine. We'll just wait to be escorted each and every time we leave the room.Next, the tv remote doesn't work. They sent someone up and he replaced the batteries, replaced the remote, then replaced the dongle and still for some reason, the remote would not work. You literally had to stand an inch from the tv to change the channel. They offered to change my room. It's fine, we'll cope. We're not here to watch tv. He suggested I ask for a discount when I check out. Apparently, it has worked for others.The room was a little dingy. The walls were scuffed. The ToTo toilet kept running at times. The number one button on the toilet was permanently depressed. The shades were a little dirty.The pluses: The shower was great. The location is fine.So, when I checked out, I asked about getting a discount because of all the inconveniences. When they finally located the manager, he looked like he literally came out of the basement, he was a bit unkempt. He reviewed my issues with the room and disputed the remote issue, And I said, ""no, it really didn't work."" ""Oh, so they lied to me that it was fixed."" ""I don't know what they told you. It still didn't work unless I stood next to the tv.""""Well, I can give you a discount next time.""Really? Why would I want to be forced to come back here? This place was not a 3.5 star hotel.

Clean hotel, comfy bed, soft sheets, big room (to NYC standards), close to the metro and had an open view. There isnt a restaurant or a bar in the hotel but you do have vending machines for drinks and snacks. But who needs all that when you are surrounded by many different places to go. 2 rooftopbars in walking distance and plenty to eat. ","February 14, 2019","14    The Leon Hotel

This hotel does not offer food, bar etc but has 24hr reception with friendly staff. There are bars, restaurants in local area so not a problem. Location was great for Chinatown and Little Italy where we found a couple of the restaurants served Gluten free pizza and pasta which was a bonus for me.

The window opens. There is even a huge window seat to sit in and look out the window or read. I've never seen a window seat in a hotel. Such a great idea.

For the price I don't think you can do much better unless you snag some amazing promotion. Hotel Leon met all our needs - a clean room, comfy beds, a location walkable to a lot of lower Manhattan. Also, my husband just loves Chinatown. As expected, there was some noise weekend nights but nothing crazy. (We all slept.) The views from the windows were not-quite-great but not bad. The blackout curtains were good. It did bother my daughter that almost every time we went in or out people were smoking just outside the door, but again, it's Chinatown. No problems with check-in or out and there was always a staff person in the small lobby when we went through. The park is a great place to people watch. Kids will enjoy the playground. Tons of cheap food options. And the temple next door is an interesting place to drop in.","February 27, 2018","14    The Leon Hotel

They for example changed our room because you could smell smoke in the first room (they told it was because of the workers smoking on the roof). The other room was fine, no smells and otherwise clean as well. It was 4th floor, a window facing Manhattan bridge so you could hear the traffic - not too noisy though, one of us was able to sleep without earplugs. Recommend taking them with you anyway!

799,The hotel was OK. Kind of expensive (300 USD/night) for what you get. There are no good breakfast cafés close by so we usually combined breakfast and lunch somewhere else.The worst thing was the WiFi. The reception looked OK but when I tried a Skype meeting with work at 4 AM in the morning I was disconnected two times in one hour. I had a ping running towards google.com during the time and it was 300+ milliseconds with high packet loss.I complained at checkout but they told me that sometimes when the hotel is full they have problems. I told them about my meeting at 4 AM when everyone was sleeping. She could not understand that.Not even Facebook Messenger worked on the WiFi. It disconnected all the time and I had to get a mobile data roaming package from my phone provider to stay online.Do not chose this hotel if you need WiFi for work or something else.

800,"I've stayed here twice, the previous time was in September 2015, just after the current owners took over the hotel. Frankly it's starting to look a bit tired: lots of chipped furniture, surfaces damaged by hot drinks and food - these are small things that could be fixed fairly easily. Housekeeping needs to be better - the paintwork and light switch plates were grubby (just wipe them down already!), and one day we found a hair (not ours) in the bed, left behind by housekeeping. When our toilet roll was running low, the housekeeper didn't leave a new one, we had to request it from reception. Two of the plug sockets were not working (one of them was hanging out from the base). There's a safe in the room but you have to pay to use it. There is no fridge, which would be a welcome addition for our bottles of water in the city in the hot weather. The bath towels are on the small side. When we made our booking (over 7 months before we travelled), we requested a higher floor. We were given a room on what Brits call the first floor, and Americans call the second floor - the one above the ground in other words. And why is there only one chair in a King Room? And quite a hard chair at that. Two people = two chairs please.The good points: the room is a fair size by New York standards, and the price is reasonable. There's always plenty of hot water, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. Although some noise carried in from the corridor, the external noise was not bad at all, despite the low floor (we were at the back of the hotel, overlooking Chrystie Street).There is no breakfast at the hotel. Our favourite local diner had closed down, so we used a deli a few blocks along Canal that does good take out breakfast items. There are also a few coffee shops not too far away.The location worked for us, we're regular visitors to the city and prefer not to stay in the busy midtown area. It is a long way downtown though, so may not be to everyone's liking.","October 12, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

The rooms, however, by some New York standards are spacious and clean with comfortable beds. There is free wifi and coffee making facilities. The bathroom is a fair size with limited toiletries.This hotel is not for you if you want to be staying in mid town Manhattan with all its theatres and shopping. It is in Chinatown close to the Manhattan Bridge and not far from the Freedom Tower.There are subway stations close by so that Manhattans main attractions are easily reachable in a matter of minutes.Most of the nearby restaurants are obviously Chinese, but Little Italy is a short walk away.Like most New York hotels you get some traffic noise come through no matter what floor you stay on.Having said that this is a good functional hotel that offers you a different aspect of city life in the area for a fair price.","September 28, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

If there was one complaint its that the room could do with a mirror over the desk area as the only mirrors were in the bathroom and on the back of the wardrobe doors- and some art or framed pics on the wall would be great.Only other issue was that it took ages for our luggage toe be brought up from the storage room downstairs and if our flight hadn't been delayed we would have missed it due to the wait.Did like the hotel as a whole though and would stay again.","May 27, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

Room was spacious and clean although the coffee machine was strange and the air con was quite noisy at times but I'm a good sleeper. Pleasant view from the hotel of the nearby park and of the Manhattan edge of the bridge. Truly enjoyed our stay and would stay again if staying in Manhattan. Good transport links and close to cafés.

814,"Just spent 6 nights here while visiting New York for the first time. Located on edge of Chinatown and Little Italy opposite Manhattan bridge. Grand st. Subway is 5minutes walk with B and D trains taking you uptown, Canal st. Subway 5-10minutes walk with N/Q/R trains to go uptown.Check in was a simple 5 minutes and we were upgraded to deluxe suite which consisted of a another room separated by sliding doors with its own bathroom/ storage space etc. Beautiful room, suite was large, everything spotless, bathrooms small but sufficient and spotless, great shower. Plenty of towels and toiletries. Good storage space, iron, free safe, coffee/tea maker, sir-conditioning.Water/ice and vending machines located on basement. We had a great view of the Manhattan bridge with a lovely window seat.Staff were friendly and always helpful with directions, printed out maps for us. We were delighted with the hotel, it does not offer breakfast but plenty of places a few subway stops away. We definitely needed the suite for 4 of us as room would have been cramped.For a hotel like this we would have had to pay double if not triple if closer to Times Square area.Would recommend!","April 23, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

815,"First I will say that I painstakingly took a long time to pick this hotel, so many hotels to pick from in New York city, I read reviews about this hotel, which mentioned the great customer service, so finally went ahead and booked this hotel.When we checked into our room our room was 77'F, it was a warm spring day and our room was facing the sun, so we put the A/C to cool the room down, the A/C was not cooling the room, we then called the front desk, they sent someone up, it still wasn't working, what was then explained to me was that A/C system in this hotel has a hard time cooling rooms and at the same time heating others.(never have had this problem at a hotel before) So we left and came back and at 9:00 p.m. our room was still not cool, another front desk girl came up, she also proceeded to go to a special room to try to reset the A/C system, I asked her if we could change rooms, she said there was no rooms, air was coming out but not cool air. So we thought we just go to sleep with the air that was coming out. At 12:00 A.M I woke up the Air was off and our room was 80'F, we called the front desk, that person then proceeded to go to special room again to reset system, finally there was cooler air coming out, in the morning when we woke, the A/C was off and back to 76-77'We had such a bad night, the next afternoon i went to speak to manager on staff, just to see if we could somehow be discounted or reimbursed for such a bad night, she then told me that the personnel that came to our room said that our room had a comfortable temperature, so in other words our complaints had no basis. she was quite rude. She gave absolutely no validity to our complaints.she made us feel like we were making it all up. The least she could have said was I'm sorry that the room has issues with A/C. Following night we went to a different room. We travel a lot and have never had this type of experience before.","April 7, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathroom was modern (no shower curtain as is so often the curse of mid range American hotels) and spotlessly clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Easy walk to Little Italy, Lower East Side etc. and both Grand Street and Canal Street metro stations are in close proximity. The only things we weren't keen on were the handkerchief sized towels and the patchy wifi (even though they tried their best and put us next to the IT room).

817,"This was a nice and cozy boutique hotel within Chinatown.Cleanliness - Everything was super clean, we had no issues whatsoever. The bathroom was spotless. Sheets were crisp and white. No stains on the carpet. I am very picky when it comes to cleanliness and this hotel met all my standards.Comfort - We had the room with the King Size bed and there was plenty of space. Inside the room there is a small Keurig machine with complimentary tea and coffee. The mattress and pillows were very comfortable. Complimentary toiletries included a conditioning shampoo, a bar of soap and makeup removing cloths, which I really appreciated.Service - The staff were friendly, accommodating and went above and beyond to take care of our needs. I had run out of toothpaste so I'd asked the front desk staff for directions to a grocery store, she happily gave me directions and also told me that she would send some toothpaste up to my room instead.Location - Chinatown is very vibrant and robust, but it's also dusty and dirty. That was the only small thing I struggled with. Still, I eventually got over it because it's part of the New York experience. The area is very safe at night. It's also steps away from a a couple of Subway stations: Grand Street and Canal Street. There's also a bus at the corner of Allen and Grand Street that will take you to Midtown Manhattan (M15 and M15-Select Bus Service.)The hotel is a few blocks away from Soho, where you'll find cute places to shop in. It's also a few blocks away from Little Italy where you will find overpriced restaurants with mediocre food. I would suggest avoiding eating at Little Italy. There are many other restaurants this area has to offer. There's a Popeye's fast food restaurant right beside The Leon, and you can find great deals for delicious baked goods at any of the Chinese bakeries--there is one in every corner. There are also plenty of grocery stores.Also, around the corner of the hotel is a popular and delicious deli restaurant called Russ and Daughters that serve yummy sandwiches and the best ice cream I've ever tasted (Halva ice cream with sesame and caramel sauce.)Overall, this location has a lot to offer, and The Leon Hotel is a true gem in this vibrant part of the city.","March 28, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

819,"We needed a place to stay one night for a short family trip to NYC. After searching on TripAdvisor and reading reviews, we decided to book the Leon Hotel. It was a good decision!We usually stay in the Times Square area of the city but, this time, we had tickets to BlueMan Group at the Astor Place theater (less than a mile away from Leon) and wanted to do things in this section of NYC. The Leon was perfect for us. We checked in and were upgraded to a Family Suite since the rooms with two double beds (which we had booked) had sold out. It was a pleasant surprise! The Family Suite is so roomy and comfortable! It consists of two bedrooms with a partition between them for privacy: one with one double bed, a nightstand with clock, a desk with Kurig, a chaise lounge, a wardrobe with mirror, and its own bathroom; the second with two double beds, a nightstand with clock, desk with Kurig, large flat screen TV, mini-fridge, another wardrobe with full-length mirror, and bathroom. Our suite was on the 5th floor and the main, big window faced the entrance of the Manhattan bridge. You would think it'd be noisy from traffic but not at all! In fact, the rooms were very quiet. This hotel is small, newly remodeled, clean, the beds are comfortable, and having all the comforts for today's needs. The staff is super nice and helpful. They have a couple of vending machines and ice dispenser on the floor beneath the lobby.The Leon worked fine for us because we like to visit and do things in the city and only go to the hotel to sleep. Chinatown and Little Italy are right there so plenty of good places to eat.This hotel is a great value! I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting NYC, especially on a budget.","March 13, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

822,"If this property had functioning WiFi, I would have gladly left five stars. Unfortunately, the WiFi -- when it's not dropping out -- is about as fast as dial-up, which makes it impossible to use any apps for work, such as Skype or virtual meeting programs.The WiFi rarely got up to 1mbps, and was often about 1/2 or 1/4 of that speed. Hospitality research shows that WiFi is the amenity that matters most to travelers, so I don't understand why this property doesn't work on fixing its WiFi, given it would be a really easy thing to do for such a small hotel.That said, the housekeeping was outstanding (efficient and great attention to detail with replenishing coffee, tissues and soap), the bed was very comfortable, and for a location right at the edge of the Manhattan Bridge, the room was extremely quiet. The TV also had a nice selection of channels. Keurig coffee maker with four different pods was a nice amenity. The bathroom has an electric heater, which is a nice bonus. If you don't need functional WiFi, this is a very nice place to stay.","February 6, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

823,"Stayed here for a recent college visit to Pace University, which was an $8 Uber ride away. This hotel is really in the heart of anything lower east side. It's in China Town, near the financial district, and all the other points of interest and business in this part of town. We parked about a block away, and it cost $40 for 24 hours. The hotel itself ran us @ $150. What we got was a clean, slightly small (but about the regular size for NYC hotel) but very cool layout. We had two double beds, and our room layout provided windows along two walls with a large window sill, allowing one to sit and look out over the Manhattan Bridge.  It was my wife, my daughter and myself. We arrived in the evening, checked in, went out for a bite, came back, slept, showered, and left. No issues whatsoever. Shower provided a rain shower head, which was wonderful. Front desk staff was nice and friendly at check-in, as we left and arrived in the evening, and when we checked out--even allowing us to store our luggage for the day.","February 5, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

824,"We booked this hotel a year in advance after seeing it on Holiday Pirates. The reviews were all good at the time of booking and still are to this day. The price we got was excellent for NYC.Just checked out of the hotel.The hotel is based on the edge of Chinatown. I personally didnt like Chinatown as an area but there is multiple subway stops nearby to get you to differant areas. The world trade centre is in walkable distance (took around 15/20 mins). To get to Times Square then you would be better getting the subway line N from Canal St or the Line B or D from grand street (2 blocks away) then a short walk from Bryant park. The hotel is a bit difficult to find the entrance, just look for the entrance to Popeyes chicken and it is to the left with a green neon above it. Reception area is small but modern. Staff are friendly and approachable. 24 hour reception, nothing is too much hassle. They helped me print my transfers ticket due to me forgetting to do it in the UK.The room we stayed in was the Parlor King. The size of the room is similar to a Travelodge or Premier Inn back in the UK which is excellent for NY. The bed is huge. They say its a king but I have a king bed and this was bigger. It was also comfortable which is great after a day of exploring. There is a huge tv with plenty of channels and free 'on-demand'. There is an iphone/ipad/ipod dock which has a clock on. Plenty of storage space. Just wish there was a fridge. I see that the replies say there is no space but i think a small fridge could be put in where the suitcase stand is. There is a window seat which is basically a single bed too! Great to sit on there with a morning coffee from the rooms coffee machine. The bathroom was clean and modern. Our toilet flush was slightly broke but still useable. There is also a bath which is great for NY. Huge sink and more storage in the bathroom. The rooms are cleaned daily by maids who do a great job and replenish everything including shower creme etc.Temperature in the room was perfect on arrival so we didn't need to change it throughout our stay but there is a panel for heating/air con. If i was to return to NYC then I would be looking at booking the Leon Hotel again as I know that the quality throughout my stay would be high.","January 23, 2017","14    The Leon Hotel

825,"Once upon a time there was a lady who had an emergency and needed a place to stay... after a particular unfortunate event on my last day in the city that never sleeps I found myself with a medical emergency that prevented me from going up the 5 floors at my friend's flat. I booked a room at The Leon for one night and was treated with such a care, the manager even helped carry me from the car as I was unable to set my foot down. He then proceeded to upgrade me to suite with tons of space and a great view to the city. I was moved to tears by his kindness and attention. The hotel is great, clean, comfortable, well located, and all those things that makes a hotel great, but the real winners here are the staff. I truly hope the owners know how lucky they are to have such a dedicated team. A couple of weeks after these incident family friends send and SOS from New York, their Airbnb flat had fallen thru, needless to say this hotel was perfect, I quickly send them to the Leon and sure enough the manager and staff went beyond the call of duty.

Existing in the middle of Chinatown means everything around the hotel is Chinese; restaurants, etc. the hotel doesn't serve breakfast so finding a neighborhood place is difficult. The recommended place by hotel staff has no seating and is not very organized. The rooms are OK but dark; lighting is a problem both over the desk and bedside. Sort of difficult to read in bed as the lamps are weak, at best. Be careful on the rate: as with many NY hotels, they advertise a rate for the first night which dramatically increases in future nights.

This is a sophisticated, upper- class, no-frills sort of hotel, however bizarre that combination may sound.The minimalist design of the rooms really got to us, the utilities available on a ‚borrow and return when you’re finished’ basis was really in tune with the eco-friendly and generally visitor-friendly feel of the place.The personnel, almost invisible, were always present when we needed their assistance. The Last Light roof-top bar is definately one of the best places to see the July 4th fireworks and we can say this solemnly since we had thte on-hand opportunity to celebrate the 243th anniversary at Last Lite.

I got a room on the 12th floor and could not stay with the volume of the music in the room. I asked to move. They gave me a corner room on the 9th floor, room 920, which is adjacent to the elevator shaft. The corner rooms are spacious, but the wall next to the bed is shared with the elevators shaft. It is fairly loud in the room every time the elevator passes by the 9th floor. I can’t imagine anyone could stay in that room.I asked to move one last time and they gave me room on the 6th floor facing Bowery street. It’s facing a busy street so it is the loudest room on the three I tried.It is the 4th of July holiday. I suspect the hotel is mostly booked and I’m getting the worst rooms that are left.

832,"So let me start with saying that we really enjoyed the hotel (it can be a true city escape), the amazing location, the little details in the interior and the views from the rooftop bar! But... One thing that is even more important is well trained staff!When we first arrived in the evening around 7pm, we came to the gate and saw a Sister City doorman standing there. He did not greet us and did not even smile. That was our first impression in our full week stay. We saw that same guy several times and he never said hello and kept on looking almost angry. Those type of people should not stand at the door! His other colleagues were much nicer! Especially the lady who greets everyone really enthusiastic :).The check in was not difficult but nobody took the initiative to help us out. Tip: even if you see people are busy, greet them and offer them your help. The night before we stayed in Citizenm, so it was quite a difference from what we experienced there. During the week we had some issues but the office manager was really helpful! And roomservice was also really nice and they cleaned our room very well! The only thing I was really missing was a tea and coffee machine in the room. And what I think is not hospitality minded is to charge your hotelguest 3 dollars for only hot water that also tastes like coffee. When I said something about it, I got a new one but the person who helped me made me feel a bit like I said too much.Despite the somewhat inexperienced staff, I loved the vibe, seeing like minded guests and the fantastic location! It's still up and coming, but you can have a great walk from the hotel to Broadway and enjoy NYC to the fullest. So yeah, I would come back. And hope that everyone learned a lot in their first year..

836,"I would not recommend staying here for at least another year. They really need to get their act together. I'm writing this from a Sister City room. It's a nice room (except for the random bug we had to slay, which is odd but okay for the 6th floor) done up in European sparse style.This is one of those no people places, which is fine... except when we tried to check in and the computer told us no rooms were available for out pre-booked reservation. It took awhile of sitting and waiting for a room to be cleaned (? It was 4:30 and checkin was at 3?) to eventually get a room, which cost us time in the city.One of the big draws for my wife booking the room was the roof deck, which was corwded, noisy (DJ playing), and full of people not staying at the hotel. It is a great view (+1 star), but it takes 15 minutes to get a drink ($12 can of IPA). The bartenders seem harried, so I will forgive them being a bit jerky, but we're paying to stay here, so...? My wife gave up and went back to our room.Meanwhile, the downstairs bar is closed with no notice or reason why.The room itself is fine. Big bed but cramped layout. I guess the sink next to the TV is a European thing? It works until it doesn't, I guess.Sister City needs to figure out what their deal is.

Location is ok, literally 5 mins waling from Spring St, Prince St or Bower Station, close to Soho. Nice to have a local Whole Foods.","June 25, 2019","15    Sister City

841,"I can’t say enough to commend this hotel and it’s staff, they are simply phenomenal!Firstly the ambiance and decor are stunning, in the lobby, restaurant, elevators, garden area, roof top bar. The Blonde woods are light bright and airy. The rooms are so efficient and clean with the blonde wood flooring. Everything gleams with newness and cleanliness. While our room wasn’t large it was so well designed that it mattered not. The bed and bedding were so fresh and comfortable. The staff are the best I have ever encountered. No question or request is ignored. A feeling of calmness is so appreciated after the streets of NYC.The location is steps from everything. The best cocktail I ever had was a jalapeño peach margarita from the roof top deck while enjoying the stunning views in all directions.

You make your own key but there’s a person there to assist. The rooms are typical nyc sized but the windows are huge and there’s tons of light. We had a balcony room without asking . The rooms are simple but so comfortable and inviting. There’s everything you need and nothing you don’t. Showers are big with big shampoo bottles. Hallways are clean and fresh and lite . The 11th floor has a great inside/outside bar with lots of seating and views all over Manhattan, don’t miss it! We had continental breakfast downstairs in the new restaurant (floret). Still not completely open (June 1?). We visited friends at the four seasons hotel and liked our SisterCity room better. 5 stars!","May 20, 2019","15    Sister City

845,"Three nights for $600 (including taxes) for a top hotel in New York was a steal. Better still, it's in Soho and a very short walk ( less than ten minutes) away from LES and the Village. I arrived only to be presented with a piece of kit to make your own room key, which was rather fun and meant you completed avoided those queues to check in just when you want to be unpacking. The rooms are a little on the small size and lack wardrobe space, which will be fine if you are staying less than a week. The bed was incredibly comfortable and, as the hotel is relatively new, had brand new furniture and TV. They also give you a chunky blu-tooth speaker to have during your stay. I never eat in hotel restaurants and, during my stay, never saw anyone eat in theirs (perhaps because it looked awful) but not a problem given there are so many restaurants on the hotel's doorstep. The staff were the friendliest I have ever come across in any hotel. The million dollar question: would I stay there again? ""Absolutely provided that the room rates remain sensible and I am not staying more than a few days (when I would need wardrobe space)""","May 14, 2019","15    Sister City

857,"Ace hotel did a superb job with the renovation of this building. It is modern and tiny but equipped with all the necessities. Inspired by minimalist such as Japanese Marie Kondo, less is better and with all the basic essentials. Each room has an en suite bathroom with a tinted glass shower (not great if you're sharing room with someone), seperate sink, window view & a comfortable bed/bedding. Though there isn't a lot of room for storage, it has a pull out desk with hidden TV on the wall, a retractable hanger/shelf for clothes, under bed safe, and even a B&O portable speaker. Housekeeping was friendly, use your magnet door to let them know if you need to sleep in or ready for cleaning. Breakfast staff is superb and the granola is one of the best I've ever had! The self check in process was cool but didn't work well so a staff had to help me get my key cards. There is always a 24 hour security which is helpful because at night it is dark and hard to locate the building since signage is minimal. I do wish the sink water allows for adjustable temperature and I would recommend the hotel to offer ear plugs, slippers, a bigger box of tissue paper in the room, toiletries such as disposable razor/toothbrush/etc, or a possible fridge & better communication (wasn't able to reach a staff prior to my reservation). Overall, I enjoyed my four nights stay and plan to become a regular customer especially at your member rates. The location was very convenient with Whole Foods at the corner, few blocks away from Chinatown/Little Italy, subway station nearby, lots of good eateries in walking distance such as Katz & Russ and Daughters.","April 14, 2019","15    Sister City

861,"That was the slogan the woman who helped me check in mentioned when I made a remark about how I much I'd enjoyed my previous stay. I've have the good fortune of sleeping here twice, and both times it was perfect. The inspiration may lean Japanese, but having spent a lot of time in Scandinavia I see a lot of that in it too. Specifically Norwegian, with its nods to natural materials, woods, and earth tones. The first night I stayed was in a bunk room. The beds are Fulls, and can easily fit two people up, two down. Not sure if that's allowed, and it would be tight in the small room, but close friends on a budget take note if you are planning a trip to NYC and don't mind a slumber party. The room is split, with the bunk bed in one, and a small lounge area in the other. The Queen room has a different, simpler layout: one room, one bathroom. Bathrooms are a good size with a really nice shower. Worth noting is the towels are super good. The fixtures are nice throughout. No detail has been missed. The on-a-budget design nerds will love it. The Lower East Side is right outside your door, so eating, walking, good coffee, are not a problem. Whole Foods is on the block, and the subway is minutes away. Best of all, the classic food places (Yonah Schimmel, Katz's, Russ & Daughters), Chinatown, and East Village are all very close - just a quick walk. You won't be starved for good food. Right next to the New Museum, and NoLIta shopping. Brooklyn is easily accessible as well. It's almost impossibly perfectly placed in the city. The staff was friendly, and the DIY check in/out process is pretty cool. When you consider places with a similar MO, that aren't nearly as nice, like The Pod, have gone way up in price, and aren't as conveniently located, this hotel is a no brainer. It's clear The Ace was involved in this project but Sister City is less of a place to hang out and be seen, and more of a launch pad for a great city.","April 2, 2019","15    Sister City

876,"After Marriott gutted and ruined the Algonquin, our tried and true hotel since we left NYC many years ago, we tried Hotel Giraffe in 2017 on a visit back home for our 20th Anniversary.Two years on it is still one of the best hotels we've experienced in the US or Europe. The staff is still extraordinarily friendly and helpful, starting with a late check-in after a late flight in from the West Coast and ending with an on-time car service to get to the airport 6 days later. The suites are still beautifully furnished, well appointed and impeccably maintained. And the breakfast is, for ""continental"", still wonderful and surprisingly diverse with a variety of choices - the best part being Gabriela, the lead staff person at breakfast (and also the evening wine and cheese reception which we didn't have time to take advantage of this trip), who not only remembered us from two years ago and greeted us warmly but also actually remembered our beverage and food choices correctly and made them magically appear in minutes. How, after thousands of guests in the interim she was able to do that is a mystery, but it reflects the care and attention to detail that every staff member showed during our stay.The location is walking distance to a wide range of shopping, theater and activities, and if you hop on the train around the corner in Madison Square (lots of overlapping and connecting lines) you can get practically anywhere in Manhattan in half an hour.I am delighted to see Hotel Giraffe is still TripAdvisor's #1 ranked hotel in NYC (it was two years ago which is why we chose it) - it is a distinction that is well deserved.","July 10, 2019","16    Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection

881,"Stayed here for a week and absolutely loved it! Can see why it’s ranked #1 of hotels in NYC on Trip Advisor. All the staff are so friendly and helpful. The room itself was nice and spacious. Loved the rooftop garden, you can go up there just to sit and some days from 5-10pm they have drinks (have to pay as I think it’s linked to the restaurant downstairs/next door?). The complimentary breakfast is from 7-1030 on weekdays and til 11 on the weekend and is a lovely continental breakfast including cereals, fruit, pastries, bagels, toast, boiled eggs and tea/coffee. At other times throughout the day there are biscuits and pastries and tea/coffee out which was lovely to come back to for afternoon tea. Then from 5-8pm there is complimentary wine and cheese, really yum Brie and blue cheese were my favorite! Piano player from 6pm All these additional inclusions were so appreciated. Would definitely recommend staying here!! ","July 7, 2019","16    Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection

884,"My family and I just finished a 3-day getaway to NYC. We stayed in NoMad and enjoyed Hotel Giraffe: very comfortable, clean and beautifully appointed rooms, well-located in walking distance of neighborhoods such as the Flatiron District, Chelsea, Hudson Yards, Greenwich Village and So-Ho. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Nice continental breakfast and great wine and cheese included. Minor negatives: 1) window in the bathroom door: despite textured glass, you can definitely make out if someone is dressed or not. Although not an issue if alone or a couple, not ideal if sharing your room with your teenage son... 2) shower curtain for bath/shower combo: for this category (and price) of hotel, a glass enclosure would have been expected.Overall, a wonderful stay.

885,"We returned to the Giraffe after 12 years and still found it the excellent, warm and wonderful place to be as it was that time ago. We often thought back to the hotel in the last years, and were thrilled to be able to return. And we were happy to find this place still as good and perfect as it was and as we remembered it to be.We stayed on a room on the 9th floor with the balcony to 26th street. Although being in NY, we could sleep with open balcony door. Room was absolutely clean, spacious and comfortable, and the housekeeping was extraordinary good –perfect in timing and thinking of everything.Breakfast from 7 to 10:30 am (until 11am on Saturday and Sunday) serves bagels, pastry, cream cheese, butter, eggs, fresh fruit, juice, jam. Pastry, cookies, tea, coffee is provided all day and night in the lobby. Wine & cheese with high quality products is served from 5-8pm every day. Gabriela, who is doing the Wine & Cheese, with her very special friendliness makes you feel welcome and comfortable.We will definitely come back to the hotel when returning to exiting New York –hopefully earlier than in 12 years.Thanks to the Hotel Giraffe and all staff for making our stay great and once again memorable.","June 30, 2019","16    Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection

We were looking for a special time and this hotel did not disappoint.The staff was pleasant and always very helpful. The room was lovely and spotlessly clean, the small balcony was a nice addition. The Library hotels always seem to be a quiet space in the busy city. The only negative I can think of, is the evening wine and cheese and breakfast served in the lobby. We have stayed at he Elysee, in the Library collection and I felt that the food choices were better and more varied, especially at the evening wine and cheese serving. Also a separate living room type area, similar to the Elysee would be nice.","June 19, 2019","16    Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection

895,"Mid-town Manhattan has literally hundreds of hotels, and many of them are truly great. They are also truly expensive. Then there are the many that are quite good, especially for the money, but suffer from the common failing of the rooms being so small you have to step into the hall to change your mind. Hotel Giraffe is doing a pretty fine job of trying to thread the difficult needle of offering good-sized, comfortable rooms, a solid complimentary ""Continental"" buffet breakfast, personalized service, and a terrific location - all for a decent price for the area. A real standout is Jason, one of the regular doormen. I hope the Library Hotel Collection management realizes what a gem this guy is; he has the perfect personality for the job: warm, welcoming, and a genuine eagerness to share useful advice to any guest asking for it. I'm also going to salute the gals who handle the breakfast every day as well as the free three-hour wine & cheese evening ""happy hour""; they work hard to make it go as smoothly as possible, and after a couple days they will probably remember your coffee orders! You can't get that kind of personalized treatment at the big, corporate hotels.With our recent visit we had a standard room with a queen bed - nothing special, really. What we got was a more spacious room than we expected - there was even room for an armchair with ottoman. There were French doors onto a shallow balcony, a wide countertop to spread out small items, a good-sized full bath with a very spacious amount of counter space along with even more space on a shallow glass shelf running the full width of the counter, a large closet with proper wood hangers that aren't locked in, plenty of drawers for unpacking, a large Sony TV, a super-quiet fridge hiding in a cabinet, really quiet A/C with a thermostat that's actually easy to understand (and that's accurate), and quite surprisingly, a motorized blackout curtain for those French doors. Oh, and the showerhead is wonderful, and the controller actually lets you control temperature and volume independently (a real rarity these days).Did I say the location is terrific? Yes, and here's why: it's right on the 4,5,&6 subway lines, which run the length of the east side of Manhattan (and beyond to both Brooklyn and the Bronx); the hotel is just 2 short blocks to one station and 3 blocks to another in the other direction; from the closest station (at 28th St) it's a short ride to Grand Central Station, where you can connect to the cross-town lines that connect to the Westside lines. Note also that Park Avenue has a zillion cabs cruising it all day and night. One of NYC's top jazz clubs (Jazz Standard) is just around the corner, and Upland and Sarabeth's, two truly fine restaurants, are just a few steps away. Bread & Tulips, the Italian restaurant in the basement, is a somewhat undiscovered gem, and when the weather's good it also runs a rooftop bar (12th floor). The Mexican restaurant right next door does a huge business, and it should, because it's outstanding (and we're from Los Angeles, where every other restaurant offers Mexican or Central American cuisine, so we know a thing or two about this topic). Ethnic joints abound just a block east, and just a few blocks south gets you to the Flatiron District and Greenwich Village, where fine eateries are found in nearly every block. None of NYC's famous museums, landmarks, or major parks are very far by public transport, Madison Park & Times Square are just short walks, even the Theater District is not too far, and Battery Park, where the ferry to the Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island departs, is a short subway ride.About my only quibble with what we found on our recent visit was that the room provided just one USB charging port (as part of a clock radio with an iPod docking station), and that port provided so little current that charging goes slowly. (Are you listening Library Hotel Collection management?) There was also just one duplex outlet in the bathroom, and being positioned at the rather far left of the counter, only made sense for folks who are left-handed. But these are small quibbles. Remember to bring enough chargers for all your devices and you'll be fine. And give our regards to Jason.","June 14, 2019","16    Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection

896,"We just returned from our stay in New York, married couple, sixty-years-old, four nights in a suite at Hotel Giraffe, and both remarked how much we enjoyed our stay. The room size was ample to lounge and enjoy personal space while the other dressed. Initially, I feared the noise from Park Avenue, but found it not to be a problem. Also, I was less happy about going downstairs to get coffee and a continental breakfast, but found the staff to be super attentive and fast. Further, I was able to enjoy good strong latte with an added shot of espresso and a yummy toasted bagel, fruit, and meet some nice and interesting guests. The location is terrific and very conducive to exploring all parts of New York. Viva Le Giraffe!","June 14, 2019","16    Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection

897,"New York City hotel accommodation is not cheap. And midtown NYC is not usually at the top of the list of districts for accomodation. But the Hotel Giraffe struck the right balance between location, value for money and great service. The subway is just a few minutes walk away, there are a good number of restaurants closeby (including the pricey but delicious Hillstone restaurant just across the hotel on Park Avenue South). The staff were unfailingly friendly and the evening drinks and nibbles were just the thing after a day of sightseeing.Our room at the hotel was modest in size but the bed was very comfortable.

900,"Travelled with our 11 year old daughter and stayed in a Balcony King Suite, which was a reasonable size for the 3 of us as we had the sofa bed in a separate sitting area to the bedroom and a decent sized bathroom in between. Continental breakfast was ok and is served on the ground floor by reception. Went a couple of doors up to Sarabeth’s one day for a “full on” breakfast, which was great if not a little expensive. The hotel actually has an arrangement with Sarabeth’s for delivery of breakfast to the hotel, if you want a bit more than the continental breakfast. It is pricey though.Very good location on East 26th and Park Avenue. A 15 minute walk to Empire State and the nearest Open Top Bus Tour Collection Points. Good jazz bar just around the corner on East 27th, called Jazz Standard (be sure to book in advance).Cheese and wine served free of charge each evening (from 5pm I think) which was a nice touch.Would recommend.Fairly reasonable price for NYC in a suite.","June 10, 2019","16    Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection

922,"Four of us recently had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Giraffee in NYC, and we had an excellent experience. From the minute we walked in from the rain, the staff met or exceeded our expectations and did so with warm smiles and conversation. The first floor longue provided a nice spot for afternoon coffee and biscuits, and the pianist the first evening provided a wonderful soothing vibe. The wine and chesse evenings, hosted by Gabriella, were lovely. Service was top notch and as soon as we were thinking we might want some more wine or snacks, she was one step ahead of us and there to offer drinks. The staff at the breakfasts were equally attentive (although breakfast was more crowded), and the front desk and housekeeping staff were exceptionally pleasant as well. The small property felt intimate, and the 12th floor outdoor lounge was a great place to unwind. Overall, this resort made our hotel time in NYC feel comfortable and inviting. We will definitely stay there again the next time we visit NYC, and would highly recommend it for those who like a boutique hotel experience.","May 1, 2019","16    Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection

923,"My mom, sister, and I stayed here recently for my sister's 30th birthday and we had a truly marvelous time. We got a king suite with a sitting room and a pullout couch. The king bed was very comfortable, as was the pullout couch, but my mom said her pillow felt like a rock all night. There was a bottle of sparkling white wine waiting for us in our room when we arrived and my sister was truly touched by this gesture. I did notice it was the same wine that they gave away for free during wine and cheese hours, but it was still a nice touch to have it in our room. We also went down for wine and cheese and the bartender was amazing: a lovely spirit and great attitude. There were some cookies left over that were sitting behind the bar and when I asked about them she allowed me to help myself. We also had a lovely dinner at Bread & Tulips (where we used our 20% discount card from the hotel). Although I didn't think the food there was anything too amazing, our waitress was lovely and we had a fun time. We also had an early dinner reservation and therefore got an awesome table. The continental breakfast was what you might expect: cereal, hard boiled eggs, bagels, pastries, fruit, coffee, and tea, but the lobby is quite a nice place to be (lots of windows and comfy chairs and newspapers) so we enjoyed that very much as well. The staff even set out a small table and three chairs for us because there was nowhere to sit when we arrived. Overall, we had a marvelous stay and would definitely recommend the Hotel Giraffe to friends. ","May 1, 2019","16    Hotel Giraffe by Library Hotel Collection

933,"I travel to NYC for business at least once a year, and I will be staying here from now on! The staff was so very friendly and helpful, in a meaningful and genuine way—not in a mandatory-corporate-script kind of way. Finding a quiet place like this close enough to everything I needed, but still so very chill was a dream come true. My co-worker and I soon realized that the wine/champagne happy hour was the perfect end to our long days at the convention center, and the bonus of popping up to the rooftop for some fresh air and relaxation was a lifesaver. The design of the rooms is modern and clean — I personally am not a fan of carpet, so the floors were a lovely detail for me! Extra credit points awarded for an in-room window that OPENS. (Just a few inches, but it OPENS!!) The toiletries? Delightful! I usually skip these, but found myself searching online for “Sea Lettuce” shampoo after I came home! Breakfast in the morning was easy and such a wonderful thing to not have to worry about venturing out to find before getting the day started—just popped downstairs and had plenty of options. SIDE NOTE: The elevators are so quick! At some larger properties you find yourself waiting in the lobby or on your floor longer than you would think for an elevator—but not here. Word to the wise: They cannot currently store luggage—however, the staff provides us with clear, concise info on the nearest storage place where we were able to pop by and drop off our bags for a small fee so we could head to the park for a while before we had to leave town. I could not have been more thrilled with our stay, and I can’t wait to go back! ","June 10, 2019","17    Cassa Hotel Times Square

Great views too.Location cannot be faulted, minutes from Port Authority, and very close to Times Square and the theatre district. Plenty of good places to eat around too! We booked a room with 2 double beds and the beds felt very small for doubles - two adults in a bed was a tight squeeze. They were very comfortable though!! The shower had amazing water pressure and the towels were soft! Breakfast could be improved with a little more variety, but the quality of the food can’t be faulted, it was well cooked and tasty.

935,"I booked a king suite to have a desk for work and when we received our room, it was a standard room. The staff explained that “some king suites don’t have desks because of the columns in the building”. After insisting, we were moved to a new room with a bit more space but definitely not king suite standard. The rooms are also dark and have poor views. The hotel is only 3 floor of this high rise. Breakfast is also a joke. Albeit it’s free, but it’s very cheap and located in the basement floor. It felt like we were eating at an airport. Don’t be fooled by their pictures or the other reviews, there are better hotels for your money in NYC. Also, a ton of hidden fees in our final bill. At least $75 additional per day in 4 or 5 different taxes. I will be complaining to the Better Business Bureau and the City about this. I’ve never seen such charges itemized like this and charged to the client. It’s completely fraudulent and double taxation.The staff were nice and tried their best to accommodate. It’s not their fault. But I am extremely disappointing and will never stay there again.","June 6, 2019","17    Cassa Hotel Times Square

942,"When I was looking for a hotel, Cassa Times Square had the better price by location for a room with two beds (double or queen). It was relatively easy for me to find a room with a single queen at a better price, but not as easy to find two beds. I thought the two front desk individuals and the housekeeping person I encountered were excellent, even more personable than I have had at larger branded chain hotels in Times Square. It feels like a hotel that is actively trying to be a boutique property, as opposed to an upscale or well known property that rests on brand laurels, I like that.The breakfast was satisfactory and included coffee, scrambled eggs, tater tots, cereals, croissants, muffins, small bagels, and fruit. I think they could have skipped the small croissants and just done white and wheat bread/toast. In the afternoon there was water and sweet iced tea in the lobby area. I did not participate in the happy hour but I did take the wine bottle in my room up to the rooftop terrace. The rooftop terrace has a nice patch of grass which is very useful if you brought a dog. In my room, the showers were very quick to dispense hot water in the morning, but in the late afternoon it was taking too long to warm up for me, so I ended up taking a cold shower. The bed is comfortable. The window shade is ok, but if there was a curtain or drapery to cover the edges, you could totally black out the room which is my sleep preference. The parking garage with the entrance on the north side of the hotel building on West 39th Street (a one way street going west) is one where you leave your car with the attendant and they park it for you via an elevator. We parked for about 38 hours and the total was $112 ($94 + Tax). The hotel staff/front desk do not store luggage which was a surprise to me because I am used to leaving luggage with the bellman. They recommended a storage place, Schwartz Luggage Storage, on West 37th Street. We ended up taking our car back from the garage and loading it up with the luggage and re-parking elsewhere because it would have been about the same price since we had so many bags. I imagine this might be an issue for anyone arriving early and wanting to leave their bags somewhere secure and go around NYC before hotel check-in or for anyone checking out but not departing immediately. We went to see a matinee and parking near our theatre ended up costing $64 for ~5-6 hours. I can imagine between the additional time/cost for the original parking garage and the cost for luggage storage, it evened out in the end, and was more convenient our way. Just plan ahead for which you will need to do. If I needed a room with two beds and the price is right, I would stay here again.","May 21, 2019","17    Cassa Hotel Times Square

The carpets in the corridors and lifts were filthy, strewn with bits of rubbish. The lifts were black in colour with low lighting, so were a bit sinister. The breakfast was ok, but you had to eat it with plastic cutlery and disposable paper plates. The last time I stayed in accommodation like this was as a student on a budget 50 years ago.

953,"I am only giving this hotel 2 stars because the property was absolutely beautiful. The room was very clean and the bathroom was beautiful and stocked with premium amenities. I have to take away 3 stars because the service was absolutely horrible and the night staff, Michael was extremely disrespectful and rude to me and my partner. I booked through Hotel Tonight which has a disclaimer that if I were to check in after 2am, I'd have to notify the hotel, so I called and spoke to Lucy who was very sweet and ensured my check in would be smooth and quick. When I arrived at about 3am, I had to wait 15 minutes for Michael to arrive downstairs. When he arrived, he didn't apologize for my wait and was extremely sarcastic and snarky when he addressed me. I told him I booked through Hotel Tonight and he laughed and said he didn't know what that was and that he couldn't check me in because his computer was running a night audit and was unsure when I would be able to get my room. When I told him I spoke to Lucy, he brushed me off and completely ignored me. We waited another 30 minutes for him to check us in, and only when I was visibly upset did he offer me water. I also had a friend who wanted to wait for her car with us and Michael claimed that if I wanted her to come to my room I'd have to pay a third person charge. When I explained that she wasn't staying he told me he wouldn't charge me and charged me anyway and said that we called for a roll away bed which was a lie (and the hotel manger refunded). Again, the hotel was beautiful and the manager Ronny was extremely helpful after my horrible experience. Its sad that they had such a rude person represent them.","April 16, 2019","17    Cassa Hotel Times Square

955,"I booked Cassa Hotel because they were a Certificate of Excellence in 2016. The location was close to the theatre district but that was the only plus to the hotel. The rooms are strangely laid out. Our first room was old and worn so they were kind enough to give us a new updated room which was minimally better. Bare bones would be an accurate description of the hotel, lobby and rooms.

956,"I will be staying at Cassa EVERY time I'm in the city from now on. As a frequent NYC visitor, I have stayed in many, many hotels all over the city and this was by far, the best experience I've ever had! My bestie and I stayed for 3 days/2 nights for a girls weekend. I wanted an affordable room that was centrally located so we could hit all the tourist spots and have easy access to the quieter neighborhoods I love visiting. And Cassa delivered! Located in Midtown West, almost in Hell's Kitchen, it's an easy cab ride down to the Financial District, and a quick walk to Midtown, the Theater District, Central Park, UWS, etc. Our room was absolutely perfect, so large for the price! Clean, bright, with a nice view (not just of an alley or other buildings like some large hotel chains), and we never heard our neighbors! The hallways/elevators were very clean as well! AND NOW THE SERVICE. It was rainy the day we arrived... Jessica greeted us and ushered us into the FREE DAILY WINE HOUR right away. She got us all checked in while we sipped on FREE WINE, and then made sure we had everything we needed, knew where to find COMPLIMENTARY breakfast in the morning and assured me we could late check out (2p) on Sunday. Cesar was our go-to guy! He was so gracious during wine hour, and then delivered our fridge and complimentary champagne to our room! Lastly, Lucy checked us out and was so sweet and helpful, making sure we had all we needed to get back home! The last thing to note was the GORGEOUS rooftop terrace! We loved taking our free wine up there! So spacious with lots of seating and even a grassy area and kids toys! There was a jacuzzi but it was not in use during our visit in early April. I could go on and on about how wonderful Cassa was. I literally have nothing bad to say about it. If you're traveling to the city, Cassa is the place to stay!! HIGHLY recommend!","April 12, 2019","17    Cassa Hotel Times Square

This hotel is located in one of the noisiest, dirtiest spots in NYC, right between Port Authority Bus Terminal and the Lincoln Tunnel. Nonstop trucks, traffic, police sirens and congestion.

958,"The photos are not what you get when you arrive at the hotel, nor are the services which you pay for. 5hrs after checking in having flown in from overseas, wanting to have a hot shower being 10 degrees outside, there was no hot water in our room, upon ringing downstairs we were told “I completely forgot to tell you on check-in there is currently no hot water, you seem to be the first to complain...”?! The way in which the situation was dealt with was not up to standard and it is imperative to inform your guests of ANY such issues, especially not having hot water. Needless to say we had to have a cold shower that evening and the next morning, only to have the first night discounted. The staff were rude to myself and my sister regarding the issue, making out as if it was us simply complaining for no reason. The booking includes a “cheese and wine” happy hour... there was no red or white wine, and the cheese was mass produced processed cheese from the packets at the supermarket. When we queried where the wine was, we were told sorry we ran out yesterday. We returned to our room at 4pm to our room not being cleaned yet, and were told the cleaners have till 6pm every day? This is not the standard of any other hotel and I have travelled to over 62 countries. It is simply not worth the amount paid. There was not enough seating in the breakfast hall and many guests were taking their food to their rooms. Eating on paper plates from a 6 year olds birthday party with plastic cutlery?

On our departure day we had great assistance from Michael and Luz who gave us a late check-out, so we could enjoy our last few hours in New York to the fullest:) They were amazing!!!The rooftop terrace is great and you can enjoy a nice view on the Hudson river aswell as the new skyscrapers they are building all around. From 4pm till 5pm you can get wine for free and bring it up to the rooftop, that is a great idea and we enjoyed that very much!- the breakfast is pretty small, if you don`t want to eat much and you are happy with a bagel, a yoghurt or a banana and coffee to go it`s perfect for you. I didn`t like that all the cutlery and plates aswell as cups were plastic and out of carton. Additionally in the morning the water in the shower was not so warm, so we were freezing a bit afterwards, but I guess when it`s warmer outside, that isn't that bad:) Otherwise everything was great and we had a lovely time!!!Thank you","February 14, 2019","17    Cassa Hotel Times Square

We typically stay in Hell's Kitchen (very accessible and great restaurants) but we decided to try a new location.NobleDen is a nice hotel right in Little Italy and Chinatown. Restaurants galore. And a great bakery right across the street.I booked for my family of 4 as I liked the idea of a balcony. Our balcony, however, was on the back side of the building - overlooking the back of restaurants and other buildings - and only had a wooden bench (not nice lounge chairs like the other rooms with balconies). The balcony was useless for us. Because of the balcony placement, our double beds were actually staggered and facing each other (which I had seen in the picture). Once there, however, we quickly realized that only one bed faced the TV so it was impossible for all of us to enjoy a late night movie or TV show comfortably. The shower was very cool but I found the red shiny floor very slippery. The ""rain"" shower head made it impossible to wash and rinse my hair - although they did also have a handheld shower head to use. We had an incident when someone from the staff knocked and walked right into our room as we were lounging on our beds (no biggie but a little unnerving).I would recommend staying here as a couple - with 1 bed. I wouldn't stay again with 4 people in 2 beds - the room we had just wasn't worth it.","July 8, 2019","18    NobleDEN Hotel

The room is intelligently and stylishly laid out. It was quiet on a Saturday night. The bed was comfortable. There was even an odd little wooden balcony one could step out onto, although don't get too excited about that. I was greeted pleasantly and helpfully at the desk. So what's not too like? Aesthetically, I have a slight preference for Sister City, a few blocks away and in the same price range, but only a slight one. But this is a better location.There seems to be a little coffee, etc. hospitality area just past the elevators but I didn't even know about it until I checked out. Anyway, get your coffee on Mott Street, at Cafe Grumpy or Gimme Coffee, both excellent. Very easy, straight walk to the D Train at Grand St. Station. ","June 25, 2019","18    NobleDEN Hotel

The rooms were spotless and well planned to utilise the space efficiently. We arrived early in the morning and rooms were ready for us. There was a USD25 early check in fee, which we thought was very reasonable for NYC standards. We checked in and could immediately begin exploring.

992,"We (two adults) stayed at NobleDEN for one night in April 2019. Upon check-in our room was immediately available and served our short stay perfectly - it was incredibly clean, quiet, and completely smoke-free, which is crucial for us - even a hint of residual smoke from a prior visitor causes us health issues.The room was equipped with some clever space-saving solutions (such as the safe stored in an under-bed drawer) and came with slippers, good toiletries, and a complimentary stuffed bear, which came home with us for our friend's child. The one caution is the sink is in the room, rather than a separate bathroom, which could cause issues for some - from either a noise or privacy perspective.The hotel is situated at a great location for exploring SoHo, LES, and several other neighborhoods. There are multiple close subway stops and tons of excellent restaurants, shops, and bars just outside the hotel. Although the area was constantly busy, we didn't get any noise disruption in the room.We we given a late check-out, thirty minutes or an hour after their normal time, and the front desk happily offered to hold our bags until our evening flight home.

This is our first encounter of such additional charges. We refused to pay for a policy that did not make sense as it was not like the hotel had to scramble manpower to get our room ready before the preset check-in time. It was no extra cost to the hotel but it felt like they went out of their way, offering to store our luggage, just to make things difficult for us.

996,"I really enjoyed my stay at NobleDEN. It can be challenging to find a relatively cost-effective AND well-situated hotel in Manhattan, and this very well may be it! I liked my room, with a view of Grand Street, and though the street noise was intense, I managed to sleep easily. I took the subway to Brooklyn (from Canal St) and another to the Upper East Side (from Spring St) while in the city, and the location of the hotel was just steps away from the Q and the 6 trains, respectively. I only gave the hotel 4 stars because the ventilation isn't great (kept smelling the restaurant next door, a hot pot place, which is connected to the hotel, I think!) and hallway noise woke me both mornings (before 7 am). That said, I will likely return to NobleDEN on future visits. I agree with other reviewers that the car service to the airport was excellent and well-priced, and the teddy bear as a gift was a nice touch. :)","April 26, 2019","18    NobleDEN Hotel

Close to different subways, close to Little Italy and Chinatown, no laundry service at the hotel but there was a laundromat just around the corner. Bathroom was massive and the shower head was the best part about the room. Room came with a closet, mini fridge, comfortable bed and good size TV. All the staff we came in contact with were super friendly and made us feel welcomed at all hours of the day. Coffee making facilities and water is down in the lobby but we just grabbed what we needed before heading back to the room.

The bed was too hard for me and my lower back was aching after the first night. Wish that was a bit softer. Free wifi but we were always disconnecting and had to sign in again. They give you two free bottles of evian water (if you ask for more it's $3 additional/bottle). There's free coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the lobby. Sodas are $2. Pastries at 7am although I didn't see any when I went down at 7am. They also have some fruits if you're lucky. There's a mini microwave.

It is quite busy here but I had not problems because I chose to check in earlier than the 3pm time on my reservation. This was accomplished for $25.00.

1006,"We tried something different on this NYC trip - instead of staying at a chain near Times Square, we stayed here in Little Italy. We got to the hotel early in the afternoon and one of our two rooms was ready. We booked a queen for us parents and a double/double for the two teens. Our queen room was on the side of of the hotel, third floor. So, no view. But, for NYC standards I found the room to be very spacious. My husband overpacked and wished there was bureau or small closet (there were two small drawers in an end table aside the bed). With just two nights and only a few casual clothes in my backpack, I didn't need any storage room. The kids' double/double was on the first floor and was really pretty big. In fact, if i'd known how big it was going to be I might not have booked us parents a separate room (maybe I would have: it's nice to have some space from the 15/16 set sometimes). The double/double had a nice closet and even more floor space, and the bathroom sink area seemed bigger as well. And, the double/double had a balcony - very nice even without any ""view."" We loved the rooftop. Even in late December, we went up there in the evening and took in the amazing views.Included wifi was good. Huge thank you for the available umbrellas in the lobby. Nice coffee/tea/hot chocolate area with a microwave there too. Our room had a tiny refrigerator as well, and a safe under the bed. Extra blankets were brought up very quickly. Quiet and responsive heating/cooling in each room. A couple block walk from a few different subway lines. Very friendly front desk staff. Loved the neighborhood! Plenty of tourists, but plenty of real people too :). We left our luggage in the lobby for our last afternoon after check out - and when I say in the lobby, I mean in the lobby. But, the lobby is so small and staff so attentive I had no hesitations leaving it there. We booked online pretty far in advance and am glad we did. If we ever get to go back when it's warmer out, I'd love to get a room on the streetside of the hotel with a balcony. One day!","January 3, 2019","18    NobleDEN Hotel

1007,"I rarely stay in hotels in NYC so we really loved the proximity of this hotel to some of the best food/shopping/etc in Manhattan and I really loved the boutique feel of this hotel as well. From the spacious rooms (YES! Spacious for NYC standards) to the adorable juliet balcony and the thoughtful amenities in the bathroom area (individual toothbrushes and toothpaste, q-tips, etc, how cute?!). I thought the value was fantastic to not stay in a chain and they had beverages available throughout the day. I thought the bed to be very comfy, and loved all the lighting in the bathroom. It was a fantastic room!! I do have to say that I feel the service could be a tad better... my husband left his ID with the front desk staff (they'll ask for it upon checkin) and we went the entire day not knowing until we were at dinner in which we went through all the scenarios and worrying about flying back home to find that it was at the hotel with a sticky note saying we'd return. Which YES we'd ask but they had my email and probably my phone number so I'm kind of sad they wouldn't have reached out. Or tried to call the room after we checked in. Just a little bit of customer service can go a long way in this regard, especially knowing we're all pretty much traveling. Not anyone's specific fault but just thought someone should've tried to reach out since an ID is pretty important while traveling. Otherwise, I'd HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone.

1008,"This hotel is in a very fun location if you wish to avoid the crowds of midtown. We based here and walked around little Italy, Soho, and Chinatown. We are big walkers, so we also walked to and over Brooklyn Bridge (Ubered back). Dined in Little Italy, then had dessert at a place right accross the street. Washington Square/ Greenwich Village, High Line from Greenwich Village to Chelsea Market (Ubered back again!). So my review of the hotel is based more on the location that we wanted a lower Manhattan trip. The hotel itself was good. Small, boutiqueish. Not much help from front desk as far as directions or activities. Clean room, small but for NY not that small. Cute amenities in the room, like little stuffed animal, bath shoes, q-tips, toothbrush.

The location of the NobleDen is its true draw .... the crossroads of Little Italy Chinatown LES and SoHo Nolita Tribeca.... can't beat that....there was free coffee and pastries in the morning small comfortable lounge. Elevators were quick and the water pressure was great. Shower had both a large rain feature and a hand held portion. This is a great option at a surprisingly affordable price.

1025,"We were fortunate that an Italian festival was being held for 20 blocks around the hotel which provided great entertainment for us. The hotel is very well maintained and clean. The rooms have hardwood floors which we like much better than carpet. The staff was outstanding in helping us figure out where we were and where we were going. The subway system can be intimidating, but they helped us out greatly with this also. The only drawback we had was that they don't provide face cloths. This makes a quick wash-up impossible. Other than that, the place is awesome..","October 7, 2018","18    NobleDEN Hotel

1027,I stayed at the hotel recently for 6 nights with my sister. We shared a king bed room. The room itself wasn't huge but this is normal for New York and we had plenty of space for the 2 of us.The water pressure in the shower is really great also.We were in a room at the back off the hotel as the San Gennaro festival was on right outside the hotel and we couldn't hear the noise at night from the festival which was awesome. They provide free coffee/tea all day which is a really nice tough and they get a tray of pastry's at 7.30am every day for the hotel guests to help themselves too. Be warned - they are gone by 8.15am.The front desk staff can be hit and miss. We spoke to a few different people during our stay and a few of them weren't very helpful. One of the girls told me to Google my question which I thought was terrible customer service. I had asked her a few questions about the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island tours.I need to call out Kelvin who was AMAZING! The hotel needs all their front desk staff to be as awesome as him. My sister and I asked him numerous questions one morning and he was super helpful and went above and beyond.The hotel is an an awesome spot and is so close to SoHo and Chinatown. Being in Little Italy means there are restaurants all around.Overall I highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay there agin one day.,"October 2, 2018","18    NobleDEN Hotel

The location is fantastic, lots of really great restaurants only a short walk away, but we weren’t disturbed by any noise from the street in our room.

As with most New York City hotels it is a little small. However, our room was designed perfectly and had everything that anyone could want in a hotel room. It was also extremely clean. The large rooftop has amazing views. The reception staff were exceptional. So helpful and friendly. They could not have been better. The location is great with lots of restaurants and bars in the immediate area. NobleDen Hotel will definitely be our go to hotel on future visits to New York City.

1032,"I just came back from a week long stay at NobleDEN. NobleDEN is a small 7 storey boutique hotel. We had two people to a queen room facing the rear of the building. It would be really nice to have the juliet balcony facing Grand Street but it's New York and we really weren't in the room all that much. When I was looking for a place to stay in New York, I also considered a hotel near Times Square. But after doing my research, it was clear that this hotel was located in a far superior location. I would rather stay in an area to experience the New York lifestyle and culture that Little Italy and Chinatown has. I am really glad I chose this location because we probably spent a total of 15 minutes at Times Square and it was the worst part of NYC! I know this place is advertised as between Little Italy and Chinatown, but the real gem is that it's literally two or three blocks to Soho which is a super hip and trendy area. Every corner you turn in the neighbourhood, there's a cool restaurant, cafe and trendy shopping.The room we had was clean, spacious and quiet! I believe it was a wheelchair accessible room so the bathroom was supersized by New York standards. In regards to housekeeping, for some reason they didn't refill our soap or shampoos... but other than that they did a good job of cleaning. There was usually one worker at the front desk, each of whom were pleasant but not overly friendly. There are drawers under the bed which is where you can find the safe (it took me a day to find it). The hotel comes with an ironing board but no iron... I'm guessing you have to request it at the front desk. The rooftop patio is nice but they could really use some lights up there so it can be used at night or umbrellas/cabanas for the day. There was a heatwave during my time there so it was really unusable during the day as there was no shade.The morning pastries were all right but you'll still need something else for breakfast to get through your morning. You have to go at 7:30 am to get first dibs. They are still warm at that time. I went down at 8:30 one morning and there was nothing left. And for some weird reason one morning there were apples and bananas... But only one morning during my stay out of a whole week. It would be a nice touch to provide that everyday.","September 4, 2018","18    NobleDEN Hotel

The shower had 2 heads to choose from and the lighting in the room was good. All toiletries were provided. Bed was comfortable. The rooftop access was nice. The air conditioning worked well.

1036,"I recently stayed at the NobleDEN, having chosen it for its proximity to a wedding I was attending in Hanover Square. While I could of course have stayed closer to the wedding, I wanted to stay at a place that was a bit more in the thick of it. NobleDEN satisfied my want for a bustling neighborhood, and exceeded my expectations with the actual accommodations themselves.First, you'll probably see this on hotel sites or NobleDEN's site itself, but the hotel really is at the intersection of many neighborhoods. Little Italy is to the west, Soho more to the north, Chinatown to the South, and the Lower East side not far to the east. With all of these energy-filled areas nearby, you are at no shortage of things to do and see. And of course, there are various subway stations in the area, meaning you'll be able to get basically anywhere you need to do.As for the hotel, it's got a stylish, contemporary look, both in the lobby and in the rooms themselves. The rooms being more important, I was really happy with the way our queen size room was laid out. In fact, the room on the spacious-side for NY standards. When you walk in the room, there's a sort of open bathroom layout to your right. The sink and mirror don't have a super distinct division from the rest of the room, and then they have the space for the shower and toilet surrounding them (which are enclosed, in case you were wondering).In front of the bed, there is a long counter space (perfect for putting your various things), and also perfect to put luggage, etc. underneath. Next to the beds are really cool light fixtures (that bend and move to almost any desirable configuration), with a empty fridge underneath one.The bed itself was extremely comfortable, with delightfully firm pillows. I really can't stand weak pillows, so if you're like me, you should expect a good sleep here. The shower was my least favorite part of the room, but certainly wasn't as bad as many other hotel showers I've experienced. Overall, the pressure was good, but it had a giant rainfall style showerhead on the ceiling, which of course by its nature isn't all that great with pressure. But, there is a handle head on the side of the shower, which does provide acceptable pressure. If its holder was just a little higher up on the wall, it could even have functioned as a straight up regular showerhead experience.A couple bonuses that you don't always get (but should): 1.) coffee/tea in the lobby and 2.) free WiFi (that actually work","August 20, 2018","18    NobleDEN Hotel

They should be commended. The shower in the room was nice, as were the bath amenities (C.O. Bigelow). The location is convenient to Wall Street. But, as the card next to my bad forewarned: convenience comes with a price - noise. Even on the 14th floor, there was LOTS of external noise that made sleeping difficult. The noise in the morning from other rooms and housekeeping was also painful. The hotel has no soundproofing, and everything can be heard. They provide you a pair of cheap earplugs next to your bed, as if that is somehow going to make your stay better. The blackout shades in my room would not go down (no, I did not call maintenance to fix, it was late and I was already undressed). There is no pool or spa in this hotel, either. The restaurant & bar shut down at 11:00PM. Overall, while most of the staff I encountered were friendly, it is all for naught when one can't have a relaxing time at the hotel.

1062,"Excellent location for Downtown and Wall Street. Comfortable , spacious and very clean room with good facilities , although a coffee machine would be nice.Breakfast is functional but not very inspiring but probably works well for the business clientele. The staff in the breakfast room are very welcoming , friendly and hard working.I had one room service meal which was mediocre (but aren’t they always?!) but there is an extensive choice of pubs and restaurants nearby.TV in the room was not great. No international news channels available (not even any signal for CNN).For what is effectively an up market functional business hotel there are some nice touches ,( free coffee lounge and free wine hour). Great for a business trip , but not the Pierre , and not the price either!Big compliment to the staff .","May 24, 2019","19    Andaz Wall Street

Things to improve though is the bed, comforter and the pillows...please! You may need to change your furniture also both on the lobby and room. Lastly, front desk people looks very intimidating.

When we first walked in, the laminated wood floor felt springy/spongy, but we didn't think much of it. Later, we found out why. When I took a shower, the entire bathroom floor flooded before I realized what was happening. We called the desk to ask for towels, but no one came. After we cleaned up, I informed a second staff member in person. He promptly brought up more towels, which we appreciated. I informed a third staff member upon checking out. We only want to keep other visitors informed and aware. Our stay was fine besides the flooding.","May 5, 2019","19    Andaz Wall Street

1096,"I regret not reading through other reviews outside of five-stars lucky enough to receive night-and-day service from what we felt was very absent service, and terrible value.As others have noted experiencing, our main issues were: sound, price, value, and issues with guest staff.We looked forward to having a great time at the pool and bar, especially since we paid the SoHo fee they said enabled them to provide complimentary cocktails. No one we spoke to could give us a straight answer on how to get them. One gentleman (we'll call him G, since providing names isn't one of James Hotel's strong suits) said we'd have to purchase a platter. Nothing in the booking said we had to purchase anything to receive the free welcome cocktail. In fact, the $40/night fee was paired with them saying we'd get a few things in return (that we never did).Funnily, G was standing right next to another person (manager?) after we brought it (and other items) to their intention. The manager said we were misinformed. When we noted the person standing right next to him literally just told us about the required pre-purchase, G just looked away and shrugged his shoulders.For the price, the room is very small even by NYC standards. While it notes floor to ceiling windows, they mean feet-above-the-floor-to-ceiling. Which is probably a good thing, considering they have the worst sound insulation (if any) of any place in NYC. The old surge protector on the night stand and randomly unplugged devices (lamp, iHome) were a nice touch. Do not go by what you see in the pictures.We were excited about the idea of hitting the pool. Maybe we accidentally booked on a birthday for teenagers, but it was hardly possible when even getting to our *room* was met with battling the crowds of teens / kids? on the elevators. There was a female apparently trying to operate the elevators, and she let us on eventually when the pool party attendants were set. So nice of them to let guests into their rooms!Had hoped for a more mature, fun bar pool setting versus what felt like an open pool in the middle of the day for teenagers, but that's not necessarily the hotel's fault. I understand that the pool/ bar area aren't the responsibility of the hotel (they made that abundantly clear when we addressed some of the issues with them). Ultimately, the noise became unbearable. We tolerated the first night because we checked in so late. The noise was especially intense late evening. We recorded what sounds like grinding and shifting. The second night added sounds of glasses dropping and scratching. Hoping it was just from construction or the bar and would fade, it actually woke us up the next morning.When we brought some of the issues we had in the evening, the manager said he was sorry, that they couldn't control what happened with the bar or other noise. During construction, hotels usually provide earplugs or a warning. At the James, it's apparently just not their issue. To the manager's credit, he did offer to upgrade us when we said we planned to leave (we were scheduled to stay for 3 additional days). But at that point, the noise was only one of a variety of issues. We checked out first thing the next morning (thanks, early AM noises, for making sure of that!).I almost raised the review to two-stars, because our last experience with the hotel was with a doorman we hadn't seen at that point, who was polite, prompt, and helpfully opened the doors for us and assisted with our luggage as we left. We told him that alone was night and day from everything else we'd received.The total cost for two nights was almost $1000. For that much, we could have stayed on Park Ave. with better food, better bars, no kids, no noise, and better entertainment. In fact, we got all of that at the next hotel for (much) less near Park Ave!If it weren't for the room making such a terrible first impression, and various staff (especially G) giving us the runaround, we might have stayed through our scheduled booking. Of course there will be weekends where noise and non-guests will be a factor in any hotel, especially one that's open to the public. But the cost, lack of ownership by (most, not all) of the staff, and lack of amenities just don't add up.","July 9, 2019","20    The James New York SoHo

We were given an upgrade, which was completely unexpected, but highly appreciated. Our room was a beautiful corner room with amazing views of the city. The gym was a bit small but it had everything needed for a great work out with great views of the city, I truly enjoyed my morning workouts. They provide cold water and fresh towels. The roof top has a pool with amazing views. Overall our stay was great, we were there for 6 nights and we did not want to leave.","July 6, 2019","20    The James New York SoHo

1101,"We reserved the Penthouse Suite for my husband’s 50th birthday. The music system was not working as there was no adapter. We wanted to invite friends over but we were unable to play music. So there went our birthday party. They finally put an adapter in our room at the end of the night but we couldn’t use it because went out to dinner. Earlier in the day, they also kicked us out of the pool area stating that someone else has reserved the seats we were on. Also, the blinds in the apartment were electronic and not functioning. The furniture and decor was very dated. On of the shower drains didn’t drain at all and flooded the bathroom floor. For what we paid—$2000 this was all a huge let down and dampened our experience. We told the manager Alex—and he was cordial— he only offered to take off $200 from the stay and also breakfast. But I think that we should have been refunded more (like pay for a regular room rate of $300-400). We were really unhappy and I am going to take it up with my credit card company. Will not go back.

1105,"Traveling for business but brought my wife along for evening in the city. The staff here was amazing. The bellman down stairs, I think Kenny and Wayne, could not have been friendly and helpful. We unfortunately had to drive in and they brought our car up early to prevent us from being charged another day for the extra hour we were there. Natalie at the front desk was also wonderful. We had a corner king room and the view was amazing. The room was small but typical for NYC. The shower was really nice though. The roof top pool and bar are an added bonus. The chairs up there are comfortable and it was nice for my wife to hang out there while I was working. On the weekends they have a pool party starting at 3PM. My wife and I went up and had a great time, but if you are not into that scene you may want to avoid and request a room on a lower floor. You could hear the music down the elevator shaft several floors. It didn't bother us, but I could see how some would be bothered.","June 26, 2019","20    The James New York SoHo

Room was not well policed before I moved in, toilet missing a part, front entrance is not well staffed, took 2 days to notify me that I had a FedEx delivery.

1111,"We travel to NYC with some frequency and love to stay in the SoHo area, so thought we would give The James a try. It is in an excellent location, has amazing rooftop views, the beds are very comfortable and the heated bathroom floor is a definite bonus. We had a 6th floor corner king, so, while the sunlight was great, we weren’t able to take in the views the higher floors offer. (We requested a higher floor but none were available.). The wine and cheese are a nice touch and the cookies and scones are amazing!!!! Unfortunately, this is where the greatness seems to end. For a 4-5 star hotel, they miss the mark on service. The hotel is VERY focused on the rooftop bar and almost seems to let the hotel and hotel guests take a back seat. After 5 pm it is near impossible to take an elevator to your room - especially if trying to catch one on the lobby (2nd floor). You are better to go to the ground floor to go up and hope you aren’t pushed out of the way by rooftop patrons. The hotel seems very understaffed with one person working the lobby area/registration desks, rarely a doorman or concierge to be found. The room was small, but to be expected in NYC. We had a very slow sink drain that was finally repaired after repeated requests - on the third of a four day stay. Worse, housekeeping never cleaned the residue from the slow drain. Walls are scuffed, curtain stained and a lot of dust and dirt build up on floor boards. There was a nice floor lamp - if you wanted to plug/unplug as needed. We could hear the guests above us every time they walked across the floor. tv would occasionally lose cable/satellite connection and you couldn’t access guest services etc.Unfortunately, this one did not live up to our expectations. Perhaps they were too high given the website and our past experiences with James hotels? Go for the location/views/rooftop party. Don’t stay for the attention to detail of a finer hotel or to expect top notch service.","June 10, 2019","20    The James New York SoHo

1112,"The James Soho is a conveniently located, stylish, modern hotel. You can walk to the West Village, Greenwich village, Downtown, Lower East Side, and many subway stops. My wife and I are walkers so the location was a huge plus for us. If you want to shop till you drop, there are many many places nearby to spend $$$$. The hotel: Enjoyed the views from the rooftop. There’s a bar, indoor seating area, wading pool, and outdoor seating as well. Hallways and public areas look well maintained and clean. Large windows surround the lobby which brings in a lot of light. The design throughout the hotel is definitely modern but there are lots of warm tones that add a “homey” feeling to the spaces. Service: The door guys are really helpful. When we checked in they held our bags until our room was ready. Every time we needed a cab, they got one for us in a jiffy. Need an umbrella? They can also get those for you. Front desk staff were quick, efficient, and friendly. They gave us complimentary drink tickets so we went up to the rooftop bar and had some drinks while we waited for our room. We didn’t do room service or needed a valet so I can’t speak to those services. The room: We booked a suite with a separate living area and bedroom. It was very spacious and well appointed. The view from the 16th floor was stunning. Although we enjoyed our stay, there’s definitely room for improvement. On arrival, there were several issues with the room (housekeeping and engineering related). I won’t list them here because it was properly dealt with. I would say the room could use a refresh - couch pillows look worn, the bed was too lumpy and soft, and power strips behind the side tables are not efficient (don’t like reaching behind to plug things in!)Overall we really enjoyed our stay but we did encounter various issues with the room (which were acknowledged and resolved by the hotel staff).","June 7, 2019","20    The James New York SoHo

1113,"It was a short trip and unfortunately did not take advantage of all the amenities (sad). However, the room was really nice and the heated floor was an AWESOME touch. The only issue I had with the room was the lack of visible/available plugs. They were buried/invisible behind heavy curtains so you didn’t have the option of plugging it in comfortably by the bed/on both bed stands. Small thing that certainly didn’t take away from the overall experience. Most importantly, I was there for a post engagement celebration and Kris at the front desk was very accommodating to help us celebrate, she was awesome and I’m very appreciative she was able to work with me on such short notice (there was a miscommunication so we had to act quick). It really added to the whole weekend and I couldn’t have done it without her. It’s reasons like these that will bring me back to the The James Soho.

Then my room wasn't ready. I had requested a room for 2 adults and a kid with enough space, the extra bed wasn't there , and there was no space to circulate in the room at all, we had to jump over the beds. We had to wait till 1AM to go to sleep. then no breakfast restaurant, only in dinning poor breakfast...But no space to eat in the room, we sat on the beds...Room not even correctly cleaned...staff not helpful.

1146,"We had a very pleasurable stay at the Westhouse for our first trip to NYC. We decided to stay here due to the extras that the hotel provides and the proximity to Central Park, 7th Ave Subway and 5th Ave shopping all being very close by. It is customary for many Hotels in NYC to charge a residency and city tax on top of your room rate and is done due to governing forces - however the Westhouse actually gives back to their guests by offering daily breakfast, an evening meal with wine, beer or bubbles and offers wifi, telephone calls and bottled water all as part of the enforced taxes. Many hotels do not offer any of these extras but still enforce the tax.We also found the price for a suite was very impressive. Having searched through many websites looking for a good hotel, the Westhouse suite was by far the best offer we came across coming in at the same price as many standard queen rooms offered by other hotels.Our suite, on the 22nd floor consisted of a seperate lounge and dressing area, a full size wardrobe, 2 tv's, kingsize bedroom and a bathroom all well decorated and well appointed. The bed and pillows being extremely comfortable and the room very quiet. We were glad to be on the 22nd floor as we did not experience any traffic noise, just the distant ever present hum and car horns that one may expect in the city that never sleeps. Concierge was very helpful suppling us with maps, tips and hints about what NY has to offer the first timer.The rooms are serviced daily and a turn down service is offered.All the staff are friendly and welcoming and do their best to make sure that your stay is one to remember.","September 17, 2018","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

The hotel charges a hotel fee for the breakfast and ""indulgences"" in the evening. This minor cost is nothing compared with what you get in return. The full breakfast with everything you can think of especially the mini NY Bagels is delicious. In the evening its even better. The location is right where you want to be, the MTA is right out the door at 57&7th ave. The metro card is easy to purchase and much cheaper than a cab (they have gotten very expensive) The team at the hotel do everything to make your trip enjoyable.

You can hear EVERYTHING! There was a family next to me with screaming kids up all night, and on the other side I could hear thing that were a bit R RATED. I know the hotel can only do so much, and are unable to reconstruct the walls for my liking, but never had this problem in any other 5 star hotel. It was like they were in my room. I’m not a complaining person, so I never took my option to call the lobby to see if they could do anything. That’s why I’m keeping my 5 star rating, cause I know they would’ve, but I didn’t take the opportunity. The staff was beyond professional too.

1160,"Stayed here 4 nights post cruise and it was great from check in to check out. We arrived early, having notified the hotel in advance. To find one of our rooms was ready. We then dropped all our luggage in the one room until they notified us when the other room was ready.The staff were helpful and pleasant. We jammed the safe and within 10 minutes of reporting it someone had come up to open it for us. We were expecting continental style breakfast so was surprised to find Scrambled eggs, sausages and bacon available. As well as cereal/toast etc.Coffee machine and soda were available throughout the day free of charge. Also, was surprised to find happy hour included a light meal & wine/beer all included in the resort tax. we were expecting snacks, but this was more than that.Having been advised that the resort tax was higher at this hotel we certainly felt that it was worth it for the extras we had.We chose the hotel for its proximity to Central Park. The subway was steps away from the front door for easy access to Battery Park & other sites. Just make sure you don't get on the express.On our last day the hotel arranged a taxi for us to the airport and stored our luggage until we left.Not sure but we never had a turndown service in the evening, not sure if we should have or not. But this didn't bother us.My DH celebrated his birthday here and the hotel left a bottle of wine and chocolates in the room for him. Which was a special added touch for his special day.Can't comment on the Gym as we didn't use it.Overall we had a fantastic stay and if we returned to New York would stay here again.","June 20, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

1166,"We would expect a five star hotel to not have maids carts stationed permanently in the corridors as its unsightly and a risk in emergencies. The making up of the room was a bit random; sometimes we had enough towels, sometimes not and definitely not enough toiletries for two people! Stains on the carpet, and on the mirror, no stationery and no room information or room service and it took half an hour for ice to be delivered to our room. No duvet cover just sheets either side of the duvet, which became especially irritating. No vegetarian choices for dinner on occasions in the 'happy hour' service. No slippers or gowns as you would expect as standard in a five star hotel and especially as one of the ""Small Luxury Hotels of the World"" - worn and a bit tatty in general.However, the hotel is positioned conveniently close to a Subway station and within walking distance of Times Square and Central Park and the beds were comfy!The 'Bell Boys' were especially nice as were the waiters, although the maids we encountered were standoffish and rude. Unfortunately scaffolding was up at the front of the hotel during our stay which we were not informed about when we booked and it ruined any view we might have had.There is a great bar just across the street and a half decent deli as well.This hotel was basically clean and comfy enough for a short stay just not worthy of the money we paid or 5 stars!","June 11, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

1168,"We made a reservation at the Westhouse because my sister has stayed there and said it is a bit more private than it's sister hotel and worth the extra money. We did not feel our stay lived up to that. The GOOD: It was very quiet, and everyone with whom we dealt was pleasant. To assure reduced city noise, we requested a ""courtyard"" view which we knew would be an air shaft, but it was a very large and nice air shaft, and on the 25th floor, just 1 floor below the sky. We didn't hear other guests when they were in their rooms. Our room was tastefully furnished and the drawers of the dresser were very clean. The BAD: Our king size bed was actually on a queen frame (no box spring) so it was rather uncomfortable. I was pretty amazed when I noticed this in the morning after sleeping on it. That explains all the bedding coming untucked from the sides overnight...The bathroom was really tiny. 5'x5' with a 2'x2.5' alcove for the sink. As the door opened into the bathroom, you had to either open the door fully while pressing back against the toilet or scrunch into the alcove with the sink to get the door by you. The LED lights in the bathroom flickered (except the one over the sink). The flickering gave both my wife and me headaches.There was no full-length mirror in the room. The one mirror that could have worked had a little unusable shelf-like projection at the bottom, which blocked the view of my ankles and feet. There were no bathrobes in the room. Although I realize this is somewhat of an extravagance, the hotel had been promoted as ""luxury"" so we expected that. Probably not the hotel's fault but we expected a higher class of people than the inebriated (sounding) people talking loudly and for quite a while beginning at 2;30 AM right outside our door.Finally: valet parking--they should warn guests it will be approximately 25 minutes to retrieve their car, so the guests can plan appropriately.And one complaint against many NYC hotels - they tout ""free"" breakfast and cocktail hours but charge a mandatory $49/person/day to cover that. Please just add that to the room fee to accurately list the room price.","June 4, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

After a while my husband jus said it’s ok we’ll handle it! Got to the room and I must say this hotel is NO 5 star I’m not even sure I’d give it a 4 star as it’s so tired and we found dust everywhere not jus that the mirrors were stained. Lighting was quite dim, for us ladies who do make up. We had so many issues as one evening there was no Shower gel replacement and no shower floor towel, also no face towel replaced. I did complain about it at the desk but was told to come back and see a manager, why should I see the manager? He should find us and speak to us or leave a note in our room. Not very professional at all as I’ve stayed in so many 5 star hotels and not had this treatment. We drank at the Den cocktail bar and service was great the first night! But the next day it was really bad, the same bar tender was sooo miserable it put us off our drink. Jus don’t go to the Den as so many amazing bars who appreciate your custom. One of our faves was Living room in Time square.The only positives I have about this place is that the breakfast was good quality and the cocktail hour was good!

We first visited from the UK when we were engaged in 2017, our stay that time was perfect. Our second time was as husband and wife and the hotel was just as good as before, if not more appreciated.If you are visiting NY as a tourist or a business trip the hotel is ideally situated, there is an Underground station about 15 seconds from the hotel and Central Park is a 3 minute walk and Times Square a 6 minute walk. The staff work exceptionally hard to make your stay enjoyable, and the decor and smell of the hotel is amazing. The ‘hours of indulgence’ from 1700 - 1900 is essentially a happy hour, where you have access to unlimited alcohol and soft drinks as well as amazing food which is easily an evening meal if you choose it to be. This is all included within the price.The breakfast has a great selection and is also included in the price and really sets you up for your day of business or exploring. The hotel has a great gym and many of the rooms offer a fantastic view of Manhattan.New York is a magical city, with an energy I have seldom experienced anywhere else, the Westhouse Hotel is the cherry on the top, it’s a genuine 5 star hotel with class and chic and the hotel goes above and beyond to make your trip perfect. You need to stay here, you won’t be disappointed.","May 31, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

Make sure to ask him for an Italian Margarita... the best!!!The evening happy hour was much more than expected. You could actually make it dinner. The breakfast was also very good.The only con... for such an upscale hotel I hated seeing the housekeeping carts/vacuums being stored in the hallways all night.

1182,"This place was perfect for me traveling solo. They graciously accommodated me with an early check in- and my room was a perfect corner city view. The lighting was great because of the windows; and in the evening, the lights in the room were bright where there were mirrors. The bed and pillows I found super comfortable. The room will probably need updating soon. There's some signs of wear and tear now-but I liked the decor and it was a huge space where I could do morning stretches and sort thru my luggage. I consider this more of a 4-4.5 star hotel. It would be even nicer if they provided robes and had room service. I read other reviews referencing the daily $49 resort fees-so this wasn't a surprise to me when I was billed at the end of the stay. It was actually perfect for me because as a solo traveler, I was able to grab breakfast from the buffet at the Terrace dining room and it was a wonderful assortment. The crowd was definitely mixed with families, couples, and adult groups. I worked from the hotel room-where the free wifi worked without any problems. All water bottles were complimentary. Then there was happy hour 5-7pm with wine, beer, champagne and food, cheeses/meats, dessert- the whole spread felt more like dinner. It was fabulous having the happy hour and easy for me to get back to my room to get ready for my shows. I didn't get a chance to check out The Den bar near the lobby. The hotel location was superb within 1-4 blocks of the theater shows I was attending. I felt completely safe. Central Park was a short walk-and I rode the subway to get to the Met Museum. I ended up finding a great health food store a block away to grab a supplement I needed. Hotel staff were super kind in all their dealings with me. I would definitely stay here again!! It was perfect for my needs.","May 13, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

1186,"We are a group of 12 family and friends, booked in 6 rooms at the Westhouse. We came to New York from different parts of the ISA, to celebrate my husband‘s birthday. From the moment of check-in, to the rooms, to breakfast at the Terrace, and to housekeeping, every aspect of our experience at the Westhouse has been unparalleled, and an example of what every hotel should do to make its customers feel at home.Upon learning it was my husband‘s birthday, our delightful and incredible housekeeper Alice contacted the manager, who promptly showed up with a bottle of champagne! We were touched and grateful for such a level of attention.The front desk staff bent backwards to provide us with rooms on the same floor, and upgraded us. They made our stay very homey. Everyone is extremely communicative and always checking in with us to make sure our stay is going as best as it could be.The rooms are lovely, have a soothing palette and delightful mix of fabrics and textures that feel luxurious yet “liveable”; attention to detail is everywhere. Our king bed is as comfortable as sleeping in a cloud, with additional pillows and blankets in the closet if needed.The complementary breakfast included with the room is satisfying with many options to choose from, such as eggs, croissants, bagels, yogurt, bacon, etc...that gave us enough energy each morning to tackle visiting New York City. The rooms windows are well insulated against NYC’s constant noise, whether the room is on the inner side or facing the avenue. All 6 of our rooms are on the 25th floor, and “exceptional” according to our friends and family.Special mention goes to Alice, Najee, Juan, Mohsin, and many others who’s smiles and “go-the-extra-mile” attitude made our stay memorable.Thank you Westhouse Hotel staff!

Very helpful staff, nice clean and comfortable rooms and a great „happy two hours“ with free beer, wine and champagne as well as hot food from 5-7pm on 23 floor.Worth considering though is that New York is a noisy city. We orignally had an inner courtyard room where there was a constant hum from some air con generators below and asked to be moved. Turned out the front facing room we moved to was even nosier (Lots of road works). Staff were exceptionally helpful in moving us and waived 2 days residents tax. What I found a little disappointing was that there is no place to have a drink during the day (bar in lobby opens at 7pm if I remember rightly) and although not the worst failing, I can‘t understand why some hotels don‘t have toilet brushes?!

1196,"We really enjoyed our March, 2019 visit to NYC and our stay at The West House. First of all the price was right! Our room, however, was very small and we asked for an upgrade. We got one for a bit of a price raise, but the room was a suite and absolutely fabulous. Living room, couch, tv, dining room table--very roomy. View of 7th Avenue looking down to Times Square. They did have scaffolding around the building and you could not go out to the deck, but that was minor.Front desk service was fabulous. Starting with arranging for a room change. The front desk person Ashley was amazing, highly professional, and did everything with a very big smile. So were Aleksandra and Moe. The concierge service was outstanding! Ben and Shawn made many arrangements for restaurants and visitor sites. The best restaurants that we would not have know about were River Park and Milos (a very short walk from the hotel.) Milos was the best Greek restaurant we every ate at! Every time we went out we got advise on whether to take a taxi or the subway. If we walked, we got excellent directions. They made us feel so comfortable and nothing was too much to take time to speak to us and advise.The hotel is close to everything! The subway is about 15 steps away and they encouraged us to take it, even though I was hesitant. We used it and loved it. We felt like real New Yorkers! We easily walked back to the hotel from the Theater District and even farther away areas like the Lower Eastside. So many great restaurants close by. Great neighborhood in Midtown--clean and safe.The complimentary daily breakfast was a real plus and delicious. Lattes and cappuccinos were available! Never attended the complimentary afternoon appetizer and drink event but heard it was lovely.The beds were super comfortable with wonderfully soft sheets.Maid service was excellent.It is not the fanciest or updated of hotels, but very clean, fabulous service and so centrally located.","April 23, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

It is a marvelous boutique hotel in a wonderful location with walking distance to many places such as Central Park, Carnegie Hall, Time Square and Broadway Shows which saved us so much time traveling.Thanks to the WestHouse staff for trying your best to accommodate us from late arrival to late check-out! Even though the suite we originally booked was not available because the previous guests decided to extend their stay due to emergency, Alexandra from the front desk called us and made arrangement for us. Our flight was cancelled because EWR had some air traffic control issues, so we were en route to JFK and ended up arriving 9 hours later than planned. We are so glad that WestHouse still held our rooms for us. On the day we needed to check-out, we had a concert at Carnegie Hall until 2:30pm. The manager in charge generously granted us late check-out, so we could have a place to change out of the concert attire. Thank you so much! You made our trip so much easier!

The website tells you that it’s a 5 star hotel but I wouldn’t agree.The lobby is nice, staff friendly and service minded but that you can find at any hotel no matter the stars.We had a nice room, a queen size bed, and some kind of view since they were remodeling the outside of the building and had a construction platform covering the building and windows.We had the breakfast buffet and it was ok, coffee was good and they had well made scrambled eggs and bacon. I would have loved if they had some selection of cheese, ham and vegetables. They only had fruit salad for some days during our visit.The cleaning was average for being a 5 star hotel. The forgot towels and water one day and I also found long black hair beside my toothbrush one day (I’m blond) Not so nice...Cleaning could definitely have been better.The last night we had dinner at a nearby restaurant and decided to have our coffee in the bar at our 5 star hotel... turned out they couldn’t serve coffee at the hotel at 9 pm.We had a great time in the best city but that was not because of the hotel and it was definitely not worth the price.","April 13, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

All spaces were meticulously clean.What really stood out, however, was how pleasant and helpful literally every staff member was. The breakfast buffet was well-stocked by people who seemed genuinely committed to creating a pleasant experience for everyone. The front desk, concierge, and housekeeping staff members provided warm greetings at every turn. Can't wait to go back.","April 8, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

We laughed & danced a little Salsa with Raphael from the restaurant bar, and Tarik so kindly granted me my wish with a gorgeous room on the 24th floor. Thank you Tarik. So far, a lovely experience,& I know I will sleep better, knowing how kind, fun, diverse, yet professional and a gentleman Tarik, and Raphael were.

1211,"I booked a 5 day trip to New York for my partner for his 30th Birthday as a surprise . It had been booked in July 2018 for March 2019. Upon booking at the hotel I had paid for a Times Square King view room to ensure that all aspects of this trip was 5*. When we arrived at the hotel it was pretty late and upon check in the manager came to talk to us. Unfortunately the room we had booked wasn’t available. However by way of compensation the manager wiped our residence fee and also moved us to a suite.From start to finish the experience in the hotel was absolutely 5*. In fact we stayed in a different room on the first night until the suite was ready. Even if we’d have stayed there the entire time the room was beautiful and reflected the 5* nature of the hotel.The location of the hotel couldn’t be better, two streets below Central Park and 3 blocks from Times Square you are in a very central location, just enough to be in the hustle and bustle but not too close to be overwhelmed by all the tourists.The staff at the hotel are incredible polite and amenable. We intend to visit New York again soon and we will definitely be staying here again.","April 7, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

1212,"My Expedia gold status awarded us complimentary Resident status at Westhouse, which includes 2 drinks at the bar and complimentary lounge access on the 23rd floor. This had daily breakfast and dinner buffets, although modest (2 hot dishes and cheese and wine, plus espresso machines) were enough to keep us going during some of our 6 nights. The City View rooms can be just a little noisy from the sirens, but this is NYC and the view is worth it. Everyone was very helpful, accommodating (brought a heater to our room), and pleasant (our maid Angela was great). This is a great place for longer stays, feels very safe, and we love the area for subway access, Columbus Circle shopping, Central Park and food in Hell’s Kitchen. #petfriendly this is also our best experience so far in NYC staying with our Chihuahua (in the last 5 or 6 hotels).

1221,"The Westchase is a ""four-star"" hotel in a two-star building with three star service. Issue: Really poor climate control in the rooms. Like other old buildings in NYC you either get heat or a/c. In good hotels, they have made updates or figured out how to give you a choice in your room. In this hotel: no choice. If you are in one of the hot rooms, like we were, even with the heat turned off you might just bake. In addition, the rooms are on the 19 floor and up and there are only two elevators, which can make for a wait. Hence the two-star building. The rooms were nicely appointed with good soaps, etc, and the lobby and breakfast room were nice (with above average food and service in the breakfast room). Hence the the ability to call it a ""four-star"" hotel. The front desk and cleaning crew were about as helpful as you get at a run of the mill big brand place. Hence the three star service.","March 27, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

1225,"I have booked flights and 3 nights at WestHouse Hotel via Opodo, all fees included and ALL payments were done in advance, double room with breakfast. I certainly accept local city-taxes but at the check-in counter they asked friendly but strict for another 53,35 $ per person and night for a mantatory resident-fee. So another 320 bucks for 3 night´s. After a serious discussion I could negotiate and cutt off 50%, still had 160 bucks to pay extra, which is simply not correct and made my arrival not that good. After all I got an upgrade from queen to king. Besides that the hotel was really great and it is a strong suggestion. Next to times-square, metro, bars, restaurants, central garden, etc., it is just a perfect coice and the service is really good. After check-out I wanted to call myself a cab to the airport but the door-man asked what I need and than he was extremely pushing and just called a cab for us. Instead of usually 70-90 bucks for the tranfer to Newark (took just 45 minutes at 3 p.m.) we paid 115, probable 20 bucks for the door-man included :) All together it´s a nice, clean and great located place just be careful with extras and fees than it works out perfectly! The staff was nice as well, big thanks! Yes, next time I book at the WestHouse Hotel directly all inclusive ;-) without discussion and than it´s a 5 star rating.","March 26, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

1227,"Where to begin? I came to the Westhouse hotel in celebration for my 21st birthday. My boyfriend at the time used to live in New York and we knew it'd be the perfect place to be for this pivotal moment. We had visited New York before and stayed in the Jane hotel. I was Curious as to why it *felt* we had decided to stay in a much nicer hotel this go round (to my surprise he later during this trip proposed.) And as a congratulatory gift from his mother she rented us this hotel room.On arrival I used my card for a (refundable) $500 downpayment for incidentals. After a seemingly decent trip I returned and was never refunded the downpayment knowing full well we left the room in immaculate shape. When calling to see why I had never received a refund I was sent to department after department and wasted 30 minutes on the phone. I did this about 5 times. At this point it was nearing Christmas and not only did I not receive a refund I couldn't even get anyone on the phone to understand why I was being charged.About a month later I finally am able to get Juan Vargas the general manager of the hotel on the phone (after badgering a seemingly innocent concierge.) And I am told that this was NOT my downpayment, but the residence fee. He goes on to tell me it is made visible on the booking website, and after explaining that I am not the one who booked this room and that it was a gift and that I was never made aware of such fee that I was only told I would be charged for incidentals, he went on to tell me there was nothing he could do. Fast forward to months later and hours upon hours spent on the phone with my bank. I look back on this stay (what should've been a magical time in my life) as nothing but a nightmare.In addition the luxury items they boast about online are A LIE! Upon arrival there toiletries were nothing more than your standard inexpensive shampoo and conditioner, and the ""luxurious"" brand named heat appliances for your hair are LITERALLY CONAIR!! My straightener is better at home.Also the residence fee for this ""Continental breakfast and cocktail hour"" is food straight out of a bag, and dried out, luke warm chafers full of average at best dishes. Oh! And don't forget the cheap champagne. So if you want to be spending $100 bucks night for halfway decent food when you can go ANYWHERE else in NY for better quality, AND you intend on being there to take full advantage every night than go right ahead, but I can say from experience you WILL be disappointed.Lastly there is no restaurant and the bar is almost never open, the rooms are TINY and we faced a concrete wall. There are plenty of better hotels in regard to service, location, and size. In conclusion. if you want to spend a good amount of money for hidden fees, and a headache than this is the spot for you!","March 21, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

1228,"This place is just shy of getting 5 stars. The resort fees are $49 per person per night. It's NICE that you actually get something for this here. The breakfast is a nice way to start the day. The wine and light snacks from 5-7 is a nice touch. The bottled water in the room was appreciated. All of the workers were kind. the location is GREAT! Walk to Broadway shows Times Square and Central Park. The rooms were nicely decorated. Overall VERY clean. The trash can and wall had some spilled coffee on it (Room 2414) in the bathroom and the bathroom sink stopper does not work, All no biggie at the end of the day. BUT, the reason only 4 stars. We had two rooms and both were SO HOT. Neither rooms slept well. Open windows did not help. When we complained we were told the AC had not been switched over yet but they were working on it. We stayed 3 nights, and never got AC. We also asked for fans and none were ever delivered. When we checked out, they did take off some of the resort fees. So, they did make up for it, but really, a hotel of that size should be able to accommodate the changing of the seasons. But we do recommend this place and WILL stay here again.","March 19, 2019","21    WestHouse Hotel New York

The location puts you in a great spot close to transit in a safe area near times Square near Rockefeller but not too close where it’s too busy. Not only do they have countless amenities but the staff is amazing and always accommodating. The hotel is ashetically pleasing and is always clean. I have stayed here 3 different times and have been in both suites and king size deluxe rooms and they were all always clean and gorgeous and provided great city views. They offer a free breakfast and free dinner service which is always amazing quality food. They also have free drinks including soda champagne wine etc. throughout the whole day on the 23rd floor. The staff is always willing to help you with recommendations,directions, and anything you need throughout the city. I have never had a bad experience with any staff member during the many times I’ve stayed. I have been going here since 2015 and it has always been consistent and amazing.

No complaints about either rooms. Take your travel kettle if you are used to a cuppa on waking up. Room has USB connections which is ideal as you don’t need too many continental plugs. Hairdryer etc is all good. Beds are incredibly comfy with lovely crisp cotton linen. We had a street view which was lovely to see all the skyscrapers. If traffic noise bothers you such as sirens & horns going off in the night then pack earplugs or make sure you have a room on the inside (not so attractive). Great breakfast but limited in choice if you’re a fussy eater. Its America! Its cooked very well & you can eat as much as you want. Scrambled eggs & bagels were very tasty. Really good choice of beverages throughout the day. Paid residency with evening complimentary food & drinks (happy 2 hours) was amazing. Only one choice of meal plus cheeses, grapes & bread. Over the 4 nights we had very tasty meals with wine. Congratulations to the chef. In my opinion very nutritious & healthy meals. Finally all the staff are so friendly, helpful & up for a chat.

1234,"NYC is expensive. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, a bottle of water, a cocktail - you will pay more for these things in NYC than just about anywhere else in the world. Therefore, when a hotel offers a big breakfast (eggs, meats, potatoes, pastries, bagels, oatmeal, cereal, the works!) every morning, and a happy hour spread each night that includes gourmet salads, hot pasta dishes, cheeses, beer, wine, and champagne, and all of that is included (along with free wifi, access to a full gym, bottled water in your room, etc.) for a $49 per person/per night fee (on top of the regular room rate) it is more than worth it. This hotel is steps from Broadway and Times Square. It's cute and quiet, with a cozy decor and spacious rooms. The lobby is small and intimate, with a nice-looking bar off of it. The rooms are larger than most in NYC, with nice bath amenities and bottled water. Very clean and nicely appointed. The real show-stopper is the aforementioned food - up on the 23rd floor Terrace. It's almost a shame because the food is so good here, you really could skip dinner but there are so many good places to eat in NYC, that you don't want to fully partake. My plan for next time is to have a 10 pm dinner reservation and enjoy a pre-dinner here at 5. There are so many hotel options in NYC but I keep coming back to the WestHouse because it is a great value without feeling like a ""value"" hotel in the least.

1241,"I booked directly on the Marriott website since I have a member number there(a bit of a price break and free to be a member). I got a standard king room to share with my cousin for one night(we're in our 20's and 30's). I've stayed at some hotels in the Chelsea area, as well as other parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Things I did like:- The hotel is easy to find and in the flower district. If you're there early enough, you can check out all the gorgeous flowers. - I found nearby parking to house the car for 24 hrs for a lot less than the hotel charges, you can just search on spothero or parking panda- We were able to store our backpacks in the baggage room on the C level of the hotel. Much better than lugging them around until check in.- I checked in and out on my iphone through the Marriott Bonvoy app. I was able to request more towels and pillows through the app. Super convenient and I was able to ""Check in"" around 2 and my room was ready around 3. You can do it remotely without being at the hotel and the app alerted me when my room was ready. You use your phone as the key. - The bed was super comfortable Things I really didn't like, so much so that I won't go back:- thin walls. I heard a gaggle of girls outside our room at all the time shouting and laughing. I'm not sure even if they were in the hall or the room next to us. - not enough elevators and they're slow. Plus, you have to use your ""key""(in this instance, my phone key) to get to your floor and its hit or miss with the elevator touch key pad. - the 4th floor was loud, dark and had an office building directly across(from the looks through the windows, office is a guess). Do you want to keep the curtain open? You're going to show your bits to the neighbors across the way. - I was aware of the bathroom situation, or so I thought. I knew there were barn doors with frosted glass and that the sink is outside of those spaces in the room. The pain in the neck is: If you want any shred of privacy you'll be hard pressed to find it. If you want to disrobe in the shower, there are no hooks at all. You have to open the door and drop your clothes on the floor. There's nowhere to hold a towel so you again have to slide the door and get it off the floor. Then you have to get dressed in the shower without getting your clothes wet from the floor. This is a ridiculous, awkward design unless you love being naked with whomever you're rooming with. - In the shower there's two pump bottles on the wall: conditioner and hand soap. Yes, it says HAND SOAP. I used the app to request shampoo, he brought more HAND SOAP. I have color treated hair so I'm not going to just slap anything in it to wash it. After a stupidly hot day walking around, this was very frustrating. I didn't bring any hair washing products because I've never encountered a hotel without shampoo. - No complimentary anything. There's Fiji water in the room (5 bucks a bottle). No coffee maker. No small toiletries. No fridge. No microwave.- The room price fluctuates greatly and there's no price guarantee unless you catch the difference within 24 hours. I don't like the gambling factor of cost fluctuations. There's no Marriott member loyalty to adjust the cost. I think overall this hotel is designed for aesthetics, not for common sense use. People say ""unique"" but I think hotels like this in the area are a dime a dozen. They're all trying to be cool but lacking the functionality. The bathroom in the room is annoying with a bad design. While I appreciate the use and convenience of the app for certain things, its very impersonal. The only person I spoke to was to ask about where to store bags and she wasn't welcoming or friendly.","July 8, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

1243,"We spent a long weekend and found this hotel to have everything we needed. It's a block from the 28th Street station and made it very easy to get around. The hotel opened in February and still has its newness. The second and top floor have bar spaces. The rooms are creatively designed and include some fun features to take advantage of it's NYC sized rooms. The staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed in a front of the building on the 22nd floor and had relatively quiet evenings-this also gave us some nice city views. We would stay in this flower district location again.

1244,We recently visited the moxy Chelsea whilst in NYC for a show. We had 4 fantastic nights in the hotel and would love to stay again. A very stylish modern hotel with friendly staff and clean rooms. A busy lively bar area which serves food and has a DJ playing at night. There is a lovely looking restaurant which we didnt eat in(but did in the bar). A nightclub is on the roof but we didnt visit as we had our 2 teenagers with us.A great hotel which is ideally placed for a lot of major attractions(we were there for Madison Square garden) and is a very short walk from Penn station.,"July 2, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

1245,"While the rooms are small, they are well-designed with nice amenities. We had no issue with street noise, likely in part because NY streets are much quieter than the avenues. But what really made the difference for us was the service. My daughter contracted food poisoning while in NY, and the staff did absolutely everything they could to help. extended her stay, found another room with two queens for her sister and me, contacted the hotel doctor, and checked in with us a few times during our stay. All this during Pride weekend! Sometimes hip comes with attitude - Moxy delivered hip with caring and compassion.","July 2, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

Keep yourself open minded about your expectations especially about the design of the rooms. Personally I loved everything about the hotel especially bar and the restaurant must try.

1247,"Not all properties are catering towards or good for families, so definitely want to say that I understand if this property is geared towards more hip, young, single people. But I feel like even for that crowd, this hotel has some challenges. At $500/night, I was surprised this is no bell service. They give you a cart and you go it alone. We used valet parking--although they try their best, given the very narrow and congested street they are on, the valet parking situation is super chaotic. It took us over 35 minutes to get our car. On the positive side, the restaurant on the ground floor is great--beautiful, good services, good food. The lounge on the 2nd floor was also perfect for our purposes. We had a big group so we just grabbed a large table in the corner and ordered a ton of very tasty pizzas. There was a cute indoor bocce table to use. Service at the restaurants and front desk were quite good, and they do manage well in a very chaotic/demanding/loud environment. The rooms are super spartan and very small. I felt somewhat like I was camping, as little folding chairs/tables are hung from pegs on the walls, etc. However, my kids thought the room was great as it was quite different from the 5 star properties we were staying at elsewhere in NYC. The view from the room was great. But the sink is a metal stand right next to the front door. Noise did not seem to be an issue--we had neither street noise nor noise from surrounding rooms even though I believe the hotel was nearly full. We were disappointed not to be able to enjoy the rooftop bar as they do not allow under 21 up there, even hotel guests. There was massive confusion in the morning as we called down to ask what breakfast options were, and they told us either the rooftop bar or 2nd floor. We tried to get to the rooftop bar by elevator but housekeeping told us the elevators were broken and not able to go all the way up, so they directed us to the services stairs, which were dark and weird. Of course when we got to the roof, staff told us breakfast hasn't been served up there in a really long time, and directed us to the ground floor. Anyway, I'm sure if you're looking for a fun scene and not worried about amenities or parking, that this could be a very enjoyable property. For me, at that rate, I was just expecting nicer rooms and more full service.","June 29, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

1248,"Traveling for work, I stayed at the Moxy Chelsea for 2 nights in April 2019, just a few weeks after they first opened. I was delighted to see that Marriott is getting into the Boutique Hotel scene. CHECKINThe ""lobby"" is discrete, and hidden behind a lovely flower cart that you walk thru in the foyer. Walk toward the yellow neon sign, and that is where you checkin. The attendant upgraded my room to a high floor (floor 25) in a Wheel Chair access room, so my room ended up being HUGE. I was given a wooden token to claim a happy hour drink for free in the lobby bar which was a very nice touch!ROOMMy room was supremely well designed and cleaned. It was equipped with a wall of accessories from a laptop table, to a luggage stand..etc. The vanity was a ""farm sink"" just inside the door. The beds were comfortable, however my room was terrible hot both nights-- I think the A/C was not working well, making it very hard to sleep.BATHROOMThe bathroom was in a separate room and was HUGE (because it was handicapped access). It had a large soaking tub, tiled with cute words like ""get wild"". All of the hardware was matte black. Very chic. FACILITIESThere is a lovely lobby bar on the second floor that you can claim your free welcome drink at. There is also a rooftop bar that I was unfortunately unable to visit- it seems to access the rooftop you must go thru the cafe on the bottom floor/entrance.The location is not what I would necessarily call Chelsea proper. It's more like Koreatown, which is totally fine. I would definitely stay here again, but make sure my A/C worked well next time.","June 24, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

1249,I travel to NYC for business and stayed at this Chelsea location Moxy. This was my first Moxy experience. It is unique. The staff was wonderful. The rooms are small but efficient- you can request a refrigerator but they are not typically in the rooms. There is a hydration station in the gym and quality gym equipment. The gym was also exceptionallyClean which is pleasant! Unfortunately the rooftop was closed for the days I was there due to an even so I will have to experience that another time. The hotel did not offer any type of points or room credit and also did not notify me of this closure prior to my arrival which I found disappointing. Again this was my first stay at a Moxy. The restaurant located in the lobby was so chic and had great servers and menu options! I also loved that there is a little flower/gift market in the lobby with good quality items! Will likely stay again for the view but will definitely verify that I will be able to utilize ALL of the accommodations prior to arrival. ,"June 22, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

While the lobby was loud and bustling my room on the 18th floor was very quiet. Room was very small, even by NYC standards. I was by myself, but even one more person in the room would have been crowded. No bathroom privacy but with just me it was no big deal. Shower did leak into the room and toilet area. No coffee maker in the room but I hear you can get free coffee somewhere in the hotel (I never found it but I didn’t try very hard). There’s a grocery/pharmacy across the street where you can get anything you need (don’t need to spend $5 on water). There’s also no room service here but plenty of restaurants and take out options nearby. The TV was great and WiFi was fast and easy. Being in the middle of so many flower shops was lovely! Easy walking distance to many places and close subway access. I would not hesitate to stay here again.","June 21, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

We were close to great bars and restaurants, the subway, Chelsea Market and were able to walk to Central Park and Times Square. The front desk staff were amazing and so good and were more than accommodating.Rooms were very small so we had to ensure everything was packed up each time we needed to grab some clothes out for the day as their was no wardrobe as the rooms were small but all rooms in New York are small and the set out still worked really well. Only minor things we could fault during our stay was that the rooftop bar accidently charged our card twice for cocktails we had there but we didn't notice until the next day and didn't know how to approach it so left it. Also the housekeeping hadn't filled up the bodywash when doing the rooms so we ended up leaving a note to try and get more and they had missed filling up the bottled water after we consumed one (which cost $5 per bottle) so by the time housekeeping came again the next day they charged us again so by the end of the trip a few extra bottles were added on. We could have said something and I'm sure it would have been fixed, but that was the only small things we could fault. Other than that the experience was amazing!

The staff was exceptionally nice, the room was very clean and attractive, the bed was very comfortable, and the price is moderately reasonable. The rooftop bar is stunning (although does not allow anyone under 21, so my teenagers could not enjoy the view). For a hotel of this small size, I thought it had a good number of nice amenities as well. We had a king bed, and I thought the layout of the tiny room was ingenious: the sink was in the bedroom and the toilet and shower had separate sliding doors (frosted glass) that opened right into the room. I loved the use of space, however, it is not much for privacy. Some might find this off-putting. My only complaint was that for myself AND my traveling companions in a different room there were never enough towels. We were shortchanged the day of arrival, housekeeping took those towels and didn't replace any the second day, and the third day we were back to being one towel shy. The fourth day they left us with extra! They were always happy to supply more when I asked, I just think there staff on my floor was a bit confused. Also, my friends sink drained slowly, and after reporting it and being assured that it would be fixed, it never was.

The check-in area is very trendy. We got a very, very warm and nice welcome from Marvin, and also from Kenisha. Thank you both! We travel as a family, with our two children of 20 and 15 years, and decided to book a room with 2 double beds. We got a room on the 30th floor, with an amazing, breathtaking view. The room is small. We travel only with hand luggage, so small suitcases, but there is no place to store them. So you have to put them somewhere and the are in the way because of the size of the room. There are no closets, to store you can use the draws underneath the beds and you also can hang lots of your things on the big coat rack, left and right from the lcd tv. The beds are lovely, and how convenient to have wall-plugs with charges. So no need to bring your own plug-in.The shower is spacious and has great shampoo and conditioner. Smells delicious! Even the time waiting for the elevator is nice, with good music on the background.The rooftop bar is beautiful but the kids weren't allowed, unfortunately, it is a club for 21+. The bar Feroce on the second floor I can recommend, nice vibe, great design. Next to the hotel entrance there is the caffe and restaurant Feroce. You can sit and have breakfast, but also get a coffee to go, or a focaccia for a snack. The restaurant we did not try, but it looks nice and with a good Italian menu.I will definitely go back to Moxy Chelsea, the ambiance is really nice, and feels good.

We didn’t get a chance to try either of the restaurants but we went to the rooftop bar and it was stunning! The views were amazing. All in all, it was a great hotel and I’d definitely stay here again! ","May 20, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

1271,"Moxy is a contemporary little nugget of a hotel that sits at the heart of a bustling district. and because its a small establishment, it was a bit of a struggle having came from a long work trip and didn't had the luxury of travelling light. We had 5 big luggages and it was quite a struggle having to lug them from the car to the reception area and into the rooms cause the person serving you at the reception, is unfortunately also the same guy bringing the luggages to the room. And because the rooms are compact, unpacking requires a degree of thoughtfulness cause you will walk into things lying around carelessly given that tiny space.Toilets are segregated away from the room by a mere frosted glass and you can actually see the silhouette of the person sitting at the toilet bowl doing his/her thang and I am guessing it might be quite an uncomfortable sight if you are sharing room with a friend/colleague. Side from that, Moxy spots a very sophisticated interior aced with a bar that looks incredible both in the day and in the night. And for those of you who are feeling a bit peckish and don't wish to eat in the hotel, the all American fast food giant with the Golden Arches sit just across the hotel.","May 19, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

1272,"We had a 4 night stay at the Moxy Chelsea. We were very impressed by the hotel. It was extremely clean, very well appointed and the staff were very pleasant.The rooms are not large, but suited us well as we traveled light. We requested a city view king room on a high floor. We had a terrific view of the city, the Empire State Building was right there. The room was comfortable, quiet and visually appealing. Loved the shower!The 2nd floor lounge is absolutely beautiful. What an amazing interior design concept. Could hang out there all day!The hotel is on 28th street between 6th and 7th Ave. Subway on 28th and 7th and Broadway. Just a few minutes walk. 28th Street is lined with Flower shops, so pretty when heading out.It's also central to everything. We walked everywhere. Chelsea Market and the High Line were a 20 minute walk, Time Square the same. Macy's and a ton of shopping 10 minute walk.We had drinks and Breakfast at Feroce which were good but pricey, but what isn't in NYC?Would definitely recommend this hotel, it was a very comfortable enjoyable stay.","May 18, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

1275,"This is a new hotel from the Marriott “Moxy” brand — small and simpler but high quality rooms, and great restaurants and public areas. It is targeted at a bit more of a young/party crowd than me (200+ night per year upscale to luxury business traveler), but I wanted to try something new and liked it.Rooms are small but efficient (no large furniture, just a bed and a sink), but with a relatively large shower, and overall not too bad for NYC standards. The lobby is nice, but where the hotel really shines are the coffee bar and Italian restaurant.Overall, I’d recommend this to anyone who is coming to NYC to go out and do stuff.","May 13, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

1276,"We booked this hotel for the bed arrangements so no one would have to share as there was 6 of us travelling. We had two rooms booked, a bunk bed room and a double bed room. The girls in the bunk bed room had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. We had a view of McDonald’s.Marriott hotel guests, this is not what you expect from the brand, moxy is supposed to be a pared down European style hotel.The pros-brand new and very clean-Beautiful lobby with flowers -Friendly staff-Comfortable beds Cons-too far from main tourist attractions, there are dozens of great hotels closer-Zero bathroom privacy in double bed room, you can see everything in the bathroomwith the frosted glass (drywall would have been better!)-the trendy sinks do not drain, very bad design flaw!-rooms are small, definitely not suitable for a family of four -expensive for what you get-no fridge-no toiletries other than soap, shampoo and conditioner -no coffee maker I would definitely not recommend this hotel to families. I would recommend it for very young hip travellers, maybe under 30’s only that are travelling together but only for the bunk bed rooms. My last hotel stay in Manhattan was the Lotte New York Palace and this obviously doesn’t compare! Sorry Moxy Chelsea but I won’t be back and would not recommend to anyone I know.","May 12, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

The beds, comforters, and pillows were so comfortable, none of us wanted to get up for brunch the next day! The water pressure in the shower was awesome and there were plenty of towels for us all!

The Rooftop is also a must do if you get a bit better weather than we did.otherwise, the rooms were clean, unique and decently laid out given the size.

There is a sliding glass door that separates the glass bathroom area from the two beds in our room. No closets only hooks and no space at all for suitcases! The slot in the door looked just like the ones the prison guards slide the food into the inmates room on TV. The tile in the bathroom spells out grow-up!While the beds are comfortable, a hotel with no bathroom privacy is not for me. It ruined our stay here!

1288,"Firstly, I picked this location in the Flower District of the Chelsea neighborhood because it was within a 10-minute walk from my event venue in the Flat Iron District. If you like flowers, you'll enjoy walking around the block of the hotel as all the wholesale flower shops line the sidewalks with their colorful sweet smelling living beauties. There are many other hotels on the same block but I'm a Marriott brand loyalty member so I chose to stay at my first Moxy hotel. There is a 1 local train stop on the other side of the block and a R W local stop one block over the other way which was convenient when I wasn't walking or car share riding. I drove into Manhattan with my own car and lucked out finding free street parking not in a hotel loading zone after 7 pm on the block of the hotel which is metered M-F for commercial vehicles only . Despite arriving after 7 o'clock in the evening, my room was not ready. But I chose to accept tokens for a couple free glasses of prosecco and $30 towards food at Bar Feroce on the second floor. When the room was ready, thankfully it was very clean. I stayed in a room with 2 beds on the 22nd floor (no view of the Empire State Building) but pleasantly way from both the rooftop lounge and street noise. There really is not a lot of space in the room. I did assemble the table hanging from one of the hooks on the wall to rest my suitcase and I could still get by it to get to the side of the bed nearest the window. There are bedside nightstands to rest your phone, curtains to block the sun, full length mirror, storage under the beds for shoes, big screen tv, telephone, laptop tray. The bathroom was a comfortable size and it has a sliding door. I found the beds comfortable and slept well. Only 2 of the elevators in the lobby go down to the gym level and parking garage so there were lines for the elevators at busy times. It was also another small annoyance there was no door man at all times because the front doors to the hotel weren't motion-sensor opening. It was a nice perk to have a caffe to grab my morning coffee/tea, a bar (DJ unitl 1 am on Saturdays), a lounge (before 9 pm), a restaurant, and a flower stall all right there in the same building. In addition, the hotel/bar/cafe staff were friendly and provide great service. If you're looking for a trendy new hotel in this area of Manhattan at a reasonable (For NYC standards) price for limited space, check it out.","April 25, 2019","22    Moxy NYC Chelsea

1289,"This was our first trip to New York and we found this hotel in its midtown location very convenient to all the main attractions. The rooms are well equipped with extremely comfortable beds and good showers. There are also electrical and charging facilities.But it was the staff that were really good. There were a couple of problems, not caused by the hotel, such as noisy neighbours and an air conditioning failure (in stifling July, and these were handled really well and elegantly by Marcos. For the noise he changed our room and when the aircon failed even let us sleep in another room for the night, where the aircon was still working. Whilst this hotel has no bar or public lounge, there is a really nice roof terrace to relax on.

Very reasonable cost and so, therefore, great value for central NY.The location of this hotel is perfect for walking to many of the NY visitor spots and very close to lots of eateries.Due to a last minute change in our trip details we stayed one night in one room and then moved for the second night. This change was our fault and the hotel was great in dealing with the amendment but unfortunately the room change was necessary. This wasn't a problem.Why it becomes relevant, and indeed the reason for dropping a point is.....The first night we had a room at the back of the hotel. It was perfect.

I suppose that can't be controlled if these guests are not mindful of others. I stayed for 3 nights and through the 4 days stay, I hardly heard any sound from the hotel's housekeepers, I am glad they are mindful of the need to go quietly with their tasks.

1309,"This hotel was GREAT value for the money. Yes, the room was small, but that is common in NYC. The room, however, was tastefully decorated, with comfortable bed, reading light, mini-bar/fridge, safe, desk, TV...everything you'd expect in a nice hotel was there. The location is quiet: not in the middle of restaurants and bars or tourist attractions, but this being NYC, you do not need to go far for any of those. It is easy to get to by E subway train from Penn Station or JFK. The service was friendly if not the most efficient. Per advice from other reviewers, I did request a room with a window and got one. The ""view"" was of an inner courtyard. The place may get a bit claustrophobic if you are there more than a day or two, but if you are looking for a clean and comfortable place in a quiet neighborhood but still convenient, this would be a very good choice, at unbeatable value.","April 10, 2018","23    Carvi NYC

1313,"My wife and I had to travel to NYC between Christmas and New Years because of a death in the family, and because of housing issues we ended up staying at the Carvi on two separate occasions, the first time for one night and the second for two nights. Both times, the Carvi more than met our needs and we highly recommend the hotel for anyone needed to stay in Midtown East for up to four nights. Perhaps more if you’ve packed light.PROS:1. STAFF: Great staff can make a 3-star hotel seem like a 5-star hotel, and vice versa. The staff at the Carvi made us feel right at home at a very difficult time. They were professional yet compassionate and we can’t say enough about the quality of the staff at the Carvi. Top notch. 2. ROOM: For what some might label a budget to mid-range hotel, the beds were outstandingly comfortable. Surprisingly so, and more comfortable than at far more expensive hotels we’ve stayed at in NYC. And while the room size was a slight issue (see below), the room had (almost) everything you might need for a comfortable stay (again, see below).3. BATHROOM: The bathrooms were surprisingly large and well appointed. There were good sized showers with fine products (e.g., shampoo, soap, etc.) and plenty of good towels. There were even dark colored washcloths for women to remove makeup with. A nice touch, we thought. 4. QUIET: We had two interior rooms during our stay, so never once heard any outside noise from the street. We also never heard any noise from the hallways outside our room, even though one of our rooms was directly off the the lobby. It made for a good nights sleep.5. FREE WIFI: I always say, in this day and age of interconnectivity, any hotel that charges for WiFi should be shunned, and any hotel that charges for WiFi per device should be driven out of business. Luckily, the Carvi offers free, and surprisingly reliable, WiFi.6. COFFEE MAKING IN-ROOM: This is completely a pet peeve of mine, but I hate when hotels don’t offer even the most rudimentary coffee and tea making in their rooms. Even instant coffee and a hot water kettle is fine. Once again, luckily, the Carvi has coffee and tea making in their rooms.7. IN-ROOM SAFE: My wife and I live overseas, so we always have passports with us that we’d prefer not to carry around with us everywhere, so it was nice that the rooms at the Carvi supplied in-room safes. 8. LOCATION: I know this depends on each person’s need, but the location of the Carvi, which is only a few blocks from our family was perfect for our needs. It is also right next door to our favorite dim sum place in NYC, the Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen restaurant - fantastic food, particularly the xiao long bao (soup dumplings)! Ha!9. IRON AND IRONING BOARD: This is always nice to have if you have nicer clothes with you.10. COST: As I said, we had to travel to NYC between Christmas and New Years, one of the most expensive times of the year for hotels in NYC. The cost at the Carvi, however, was almost insanely cheap. The hotel definitely punches above its weight in terms of value for your money. CONS (all relatively minor):1. ROOM SIZE: So, the rooms were pros for the reasons I listed previously, but one of the downsides is that the rooms, or should I say the more budget rooms we stayed in, were really small. Although, given the price it shouldn’t be that surprising. It wasn’t a problem for us because we left our larger luggage with family and packed light during our stays, but it might be problem for some with larger luggage, particularly because of…2. STORAGE: In the rooms we had, there was VERY little storage. Again, this wasn’t much of an issue for us, but if you’ve packed suits or a lot of clothes that need to be hung up, you might find this problematic. This is why I think that the Carvi is perfect for shorter stays, but may be problematic for anyone wanting to stay longer term.3. POWER OUTLETS: Another issue is there were hardly any power outlets available in the rooms. This could definitely be a problem if, like my wife and I, each person has multiple electronic devises (e.g., phone, laptop, tablet, etc.) to charge.4. NO BAR/RESTAURANT: OK, so this is exceptionally minor, but the hotel is small and does not have a bar or restaurant attached to it. So, no nightcap before bed at the hotel. This didn’t bother us at all because there are plenty of bars in the neighborhood, there is a diner directly across the street for breakfast, and as I mentioned before, Kung Fu Little Steamed Buns Ramen is RIGHT NEXT DOOR! Haha!So, despite some relatively minor cons with the Carvi, we highly recommend the hotel for anyone wanting or needing to stay for a short time in Midtown East Manhattan, NYC.","March 10, 2018","23    Carvi NYC

1314,"Have been here this week, stayed with a friend. The bed is a decent one, shower quite good, even though annoying that the shower head can not be taken off the hook, but water temperature was excellent. We’ve had an interior room, with no window so it was very quiet. I would’ve liked to know before booking that there is no window though, so perhaps advertising correctly with travel agents to avoid disappointment would be a good idea.The excellent addition to our stay was the super star receptionist lady: Lucy, who checked us in and was there through our whole stay. She couldn’t do enough to help us out with everything: directions, umbrellas, extra duvet, wine glasses, anything you want, name it and she’s there to help! In whole honesty, she’s a real asset to the hotel, such a welcoming and friendly, helpful Many thanks again Lucy and wishing you all the best!","March 3, 2018","23    Carvi NYC

1336,"Firstly, I have to say that the location of this hotel is very good. Walking distance from Central Park and very close to both 51st & 59th Street subway stations...those two stations get you to so many different parts of the City.Unfortunately, that was pretty much the only positive with this hotel, which actually has all the standards that people in the UK might associate with a budget hotel chain. The price is not cheap enough to justify such a slack approach to decor and service.The windows are so thin that, if your room is at the front of the hotel, you will get very little sleep thanks to all the car and van horns outside. The windows were also very dark, with blocked views of the outside street. There was no restaurant or bar in the hotel and the restaurant opposite, which the Carvi give you a 10% discount for, was awful. We went in for coffee one day as we had to leave our room for 15 minutes (evidently being out of our room for 7 hours with a ""service"" sign on the door handle wasn't enough time for our room to be cleaned) and the place was really old fashioned and not very clean. One of our mugs had two bright lipstick marks on it!! In the hotel room, the old fashioned shower cubicle leaked under the door/screen each time we showered, meaning we had to waste towels drying the floor each day. When we checked out we were never actually asked how our stay was at any point. The final poor point of this hotel was that the wardrobe space is almost non-existent (space for about 7 hangers and no length for anything longer than shirts) and there are very few hooks elsewhere in the room. Even Travelodge hotels (with all due respect) manage to solve the wardrobe space issues better than this hotel do.Throughout our stay we had no real interaction from staff and the entrance area/lobby was about that same size as our room, which meant there was nowhere to relax. When we were waiting for our car to collect us at the end of our trip, we had to sit through members of staff moaning about not getting paid their overtime and there was literally nowhere for us to go to avoid these ""private"" conversations.","December 3, 2016","23    Carvi NYC

Tube station on Lexington is just a 5 min walk away from which you can easily access all areas of the city. On arrival at JFK we paid $70 for a taxi to hotel.

The front desk staff was pleasant and professional, the room (one king bed) was a comfortable size -- neither cramped nor spacious, with a good-sized bathroom and ample closet. The bed was *very* comfortable. The price was quite good for what you get, and included many extras that other hotels charge for: WiFi, premium TV channels, on-demand TV. Even the minibar was reasonably priced (a bag of cookies cost me $3). My biggest complaint is that the bathroom door had a spring closure that would result in it slamming on its own. I ended up putting a towel in the door to keep it from closing all the way. Also, the number of towels they provided would have been skimpy for a couple, though I'm sure you could ask for more towels if you need.

Enjoyed the rooftop bar nightly (not a thumping party scene but a beautiful terrace and view) Nice breakfast with the NY Times (old school paper!) and happy hour was a welcome refuge to look forward to after hot summer days playing tourist. Shout out to Steven (doorman) who was always congenial and offered help to find the unmarked airport express bus stop a block away. Birthday champagne and chocolates were waiting in my room as ordered by a friend.

The breakfast and afternoon reception was something we looked forward to each day.

1388,"We have stayed in a different hotel every time we visit NY but will definately go back to the Library otel, it is a firm favourite. The staff are all very pleasant, helpful and friendly and go the extra mile to make you welcome and comfortable. We mentioned it was my husbands birthday during our stay and came back to our room to a lovely bottle of red wine and a card from The Librarians, thank you!We had a petite room, which was so cosy, comfortable and clean (housekeeping do a great job, they are unobtrusive and there is a turn down service). We had two large windows, aircon, tv & dvd, fridge, bath and shower, complimentary toiletries, wardrobe, drawers, a safe, large mirrors, great lighting and a very comfortable bed. We were on the 11th floor (Philosophy!) which was far enough up to not be troubled with street noise, we slept soundly as there were no banging doors, noisy guests or elevator noise.. bliss. The complimentary breakfast was plentiful, fresh and there was a great variety to enjoy with your complimentary newspaper in the lovely ambience of the Reading Room, overlooking Library Way, with a view of the NY Public Library. You can make use of the Reading Room and enjoy complimentary drinks and snacks 24 hours, as well as prosecco, wine and cheese every evening from 5-8pm. Things like this make the hotel a comfort you look forward to returning to, rather than just a place to sleep.There is a business centre with two internet pcs and printer, with free use. The hotel has a very popular restaurant, Madison and Vine and room service is available at a very reasonable cost. There is also a roof terrace, bar and lounge.The hotel is in a great location, very close to Grand Central, Bryant Park, Fifth Avenue and the subway all within easy walking distance.Thank you so much to all of the Librarians for making our latest stay in beautiful New York City a memorable one. We will see you again.","April 22, 2019","24    Library Hotel by Library Hotel Collection

1389,"I can only endorse all the positive things already said about this hotel. We were very kindly given an upgraded room (thank you Librarians!). We were visiting New York from Scotland to celebrate my 60th birthday. My husband had researched and chosen this hotel and WOW it did not disappoint. From the excellent location to the 2nd floor Reading Room and all of it's amenities. We packed a lot into our few days stay in NY but I can honestly say that the Library Hotel is one of the big highlights of our holiday. I must also mention the Librarians, without exception everyone we encountered were an absolute credit to the hotel.I hope to return to this wonderful hotel and I'm recommending to all my friends that they MUST book this hotel should they be planning a trip to NY.","April 22, 2019","24    Library Hotel by Library Hotel Collection

1393,"Just got back from a great 5 days in New York. I wanted it to be really special, as it was a treat for my sister’s 60th birthday. My brother and sister in law recommended The Library, and I am so glad they did. I could not fault this hotel. It was amazing in every way. The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The Reading Room was ideal for us, especially the complimentary wine and nibbles between 5pm and 8pm! It was great to get a wee prosecco and a nibble before we ventured out at night. So relaxing, especially with the subtle background music. The breakfast was perfect for us – juices, cereals, bagels and bread (which the staff were happy to toast for you), and the fresh fruit cocktail was delicious. You could also pop in to the Reading Room at any time for a tea/coffee and a biscuit or a piece of fruit just to chill out. The staff were also fantastic. The reception staff (so friendly and helpful with any advice we had), all the girls who worked in the Reading Room (were just lovely and so attentive), the staff in the rooftop bar, the guys who worked on the door and the cleaners. The location is ideal. Just round the corner from 2 different subway stations (Bryant Park and Grand Central Terminal). Also if you are travelling from Newark Airport, there is an express bus that drops you just round the corner from the hotel. Can you tell that I liked it?","April 15, 2019","24    Library Hotel by Library Hotel Collection

It’s a great location with so many places you can walk to nearby - Grand Central Station, Central Park, Times Square, Empire State Building and many more. The hotel itself is perfect - you always feel welcome and very personal. The continetal breakfast, wine & cheese reception and 24hour refreshments are great - it really added to our holiday experience. The room was big enough for two with lots of little extras like chocolates and a daily weather report. The bed was really comfy too.

1397,"No one wants to find a bug inter bed, any type of bug but that's what I had after one night at the Four Points Midtown West. I called to reception and said there was bug in my bed and I wasn't sure if it was a bed bug or not. It took maintenance 35 minutes to get up to my room. which was much longer than I wanted to stay there. In that time I must have called down to reception at lest 3 times.They really didn't seem to know how to deal with the situation. Finally they said they would dry clean all my clothes (which they really meant was putting them through a regular dryer) and steam my luggage. Which they did.All I wanted to do was to leave the hotel, just get out of there but they weren't prepared to move me unless I paid for a new hotel and I assume they would refund me my stay. This was impossible at such short notice as there was no way I wanted to go to another Four Points and everywhere decent seemed to be about $400 plus taxes per night.I was frustrated and mad as I honestly didn't think they dealt with this the way I expected.IN the end, as I couldn't see another way around t, I moved rooms to another floor, asked them to deep clean the room I entered nd just stayed there for the rest of the time.Grissele at reception, tried her best to help me but the decisions weren't hers to make. I tried to sort it through Marriott but they were zero help saying all decisions were made at hotel level.Well that's my last ism at a Four Points.Just to add I'm gold level status withMarriott and even with that they had no interest at all in helping me.","July 2, 2019","25    Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Midtown West

It was also very clean and the bed was comfortable. There was complimentary coffee and water both in the room and the lobby.There is the typical noise level you can expect from NY during the day but at night it's way quieter than being right in Times Square. I noticed some reviews complaining about construction noise at night but that has been addressed by the hotel and I didn't hear any during my stay.The subway, line 7, station is an easy walk and I felt safe walking back to the hotel alone at night.

The last night was the worst - construction noise made it absolutely impossible to sleep, the night before an important meeting.To future guests: under no circumstances allow yourself to be placed in a room facing westTo the hotel: please don't set unrealistic expectations about construction noise. It always started at 10:30pm when I was already in bed -- if I'd realized it would be every night, I would have gotten myself moved during the day.","May 2, 2019","25    Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Midtown West

Although they’re small, a lot of storage areas are provided so a couple won’t feel cramped. Breakfast is available but wasn’t included with our room. The location is only about 10 minutes from the nearest subway station which was very convenient for us. The folks at the desk were very friendly and accommodating.

It’s locations is excellent if you are attending a conference or tradeshow at the Javits Center. It’s two blocks away and a straight shot down 35th. Check in was quick, friendly and efficient. I went up to my room in the bank of two elevators. I was worried I would wait for the elevator during the week considering there were only two but I never waited. There are only 6-7 rooms on each floor (it’s either 6 or 8 but I don’t recall). I had a single queen. The room was quite compact but perfectly fine for a single traveler. Would have been fine for a couple too. There was enough space for my luggage and enough closet space to place my clothes. The only thing missing I would have liked was a mini-fridge. The bed is on a platform so it’s higher than normal but fine. Mattress was firm enough for me. The bathroom is smaller but not to small. Single vanity but not a lot of counter space though. The washroom needs a small shelf somewhere. The walk in shower is a nice size too. Water pressure for the shower was fine but the water pressure for the sink was quite week. The staff downstairs in the lobby were great and friendly. The restaurant was good and the staff were great. Only downside is the construction noise which isn’t the hotels fault.

1415,"My daughter and I stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton Midtown September 21-25. This hotel was absolutely perfect! Our room was not huge, but by NY standards it was well above average. We had the King Bed room and it was more than enough space for two people. The room was incredibly clean. The bedding was perfect and there was more than enough for my daughter and I to divide up so that we weren't pulling on each others covers all night. The provided closet and drawers were more than enough space to keep all of our belongings and luggage tucked away. Though there was construction going on, we barely heard anything in our room. The extensive window shades/curtains/sheers blocked out ALL of the light so we could sleep as late as we wanted. Each room has it's own thermostat so we could keep it at whatever temperature made us comfortable. Our room was directly across from the elevator, and unless someone was exiting on our floor, you barely heard it. Pretty much the same noise level that one would encounter if they were staying in a hotel in the suburbs, which is pretty incredible when you're in the middle of the city. The location of this hotel is outstanding! It is located less than a block away from the 7 train which is one of the cleanest and safest subway stations we encountered on our stay. It's one stop away from Times Square. A couple of blocks away is the entrance for the High Line, which is a gorgeous must see and at the other end is Chelsea Market. There is a lovely cafe on the corner that is literally steps outside of the hotel entrance. If we didn't already love this hotel enough, what really sealed the deal is that in a moment of panic, they saved the day. We had ordered a car to pick us up to take us back to the airport, but due to the president being in town, the roads were getting shut down and our planned car service couldn't reach us. I had looked up Uber and Yellow Cab and they would be almost another hour out. Eddie, who I believe is the manager was keeping an eye on us, making sure everything was okay while we waited for our car. He checked in after our service cancelled and were starting to panic that we weren't going to make it to the airport in time. He said he would see if he could get his driver to pick us up. THREE minutes later Tino was there and we were on our way! I cannot say enough great things about this hotel and it's the only place I will ever stay in the city when we return!

1417,"I really tried to give this hotel five stars. After all, it was impeccably clean, with modern rooms, and nifty light switches, a nice comfortable bed, snazzy bathroom lay-out with sliding door, glass shower enclosure, and pristine faucet fixtures. I really appreciated the elevated window sills that enabled me to walk around buck naked without fear of being spied upon by secret admirers in adjacent or opposite buildings. The pull-down shades and blinds were an excellent touch to keep the room extra dark, and the ventilation system didn’t sound like a bunch of leaf blowers in my neighbor’s yard.Unfortunately, the value wasn’t there. There’s no way that I can give Four Points Sheraton five stars for the price I paid. And yes, I realize this is New York City, and everything here is super expensive, but even with a negotiated corporate rate, I ended up paying over $1000 for two nights including a couple of breakfasts I hosted for one other colleague. That’s just not right.Let’s also talk the room, shall we? Yes, it was clean and modern, but it was also the size of a king bed with four feet on either side. The ventilation system was so convoluted, neither I nor my two other colleagues could figure out how to turn it on properly – too many buttons, too unintuitive a design to be practical for folks not living there full-time. The gym was so small, I didn’t even bother going. And while the bathroom was clean, the water pressure was a joke. The water in the sink faucet trickled so slowly, it would have taken an hour to fill up a gallon container. Why does this matter? Well, I am all for conserving water, but there are limits. I still like to be able to wash down toothpaste spit. I still like there to be hot water within five minutes of me activating the faucet. I don’t really appreciate the hypocrisy of the hotel ignoring my on-line willingness to skip room service only for it to restrict my water consumption as if I were an irresponsible teenager. The shower wasn’t much better – my colleague complained the first day that she wasn’t even able to rinse out the conditioner from her hair.Let’s also talk about the restaurant downstairs. Four points Sheraton seems to be entry level, like a Hampton in the Hilton line. And yet Four points Sheraton makes you buy your own breakfast, and what a crummy expensive one it is. It was virtually impossible to get out of there for under $30, and for what? Slimy scrambled eggs cooked in oil with the saltiest chicken sausage east of the Mississippi along with hash browns and a couple pieces of toast? No thank you. Breakfast should have been complimentary, especially since there was construction on the street below that woke up a LOT of people at 6 AM. Management did leave a letter on the desk in the room informing us that they had no control over this, but they still should have considered this as part of the overall experience. After all, not all of the suffering should be endured by the customer. I fault Four Points Sheraton for not doing enough (or anything) to compensate its customers for this inconvenience in light of its high prices and an a la carte breakfast system. I left utterly convinced that this place should have cost SIGNIFICANTLY less, and that management was taking advantage of its clientele.In summary, I give Four Points four stars for being clean, proper, and “correct”, but a huge negative star for lacking value. I would only return if this were addressed AND if someone rectified the ridiculously poor water pressure situation.","September 14, 2018","25    Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Midtown West

1422,"Efficient but personality-free hotel is convenient to the High Line, Javits Center, Times Square, Macy's. Rooms are super small, like ""you can't really walk around your bed"" small. Which is fairly typical in NY. Some of the front desk staff was helpful, although the guy who checked us in was that special mix of disinterested and clueless-- told us he could not sign us up for points (wrong), told us we had a bathtub (super wrong! later another staffer told us there were no bathtubs in the entire hotel!) No lobby area, really. The place seems clean and you can get to local attractions mentioned above or to the subway quite quickly. I was pleasantly surprised that our SPG membership resulted in a generously late check out. Each pro was balanced by a con:later I was taken aback that we had to check out in person, but fortunately there was not a long line. Missed room service cut off by minutes and the bar would not consider even a snack or dessert. So definitely not a service-driven location although all the staff (including the disinterested and clueless guy) was pleasant. We had a nice view across the block-- nothing fancy, just a glimpse of the walk up apartments facing the hotel, and over the rooftops. A classic New York vista, and one that seems endangered given the unbridled level of demolition and building going on right now.

1423,"We were driving into NYC when our car had problems coming through the Lincoln Tunnel, we were only able to get one block from the tunnel when the car broke down steps from the Four Points hotel at 444 10th Ave NY. It was raining, so while we were waiting for help we went into the hotel. Patrick Dadie asked us what we needed, thinking we were going to be checking in. I told him about the car, and he jumped into action! He called another front desk person to take over for him, and told us he was getting his own car out of the parking lot to see if he could give us a battery charge. He provided us all with umbrellas, and a moment later he pulled up his car to connect the battery chargers. After a while we realized this wasn't enough to fix the car, so we had to settle into the waiting area of the lobby. Patrick offered us drinks and made the restrooms available to us while waiting. He couldn't have been more accommodating and helpful! Unfortunately we weren't staying at this hotel, but the next time I need to stay in NY, or if anyone I know needs a hotel, this one would be my choice. It's one block from the Javits Convention Center, and a very convenient location to walk to 42nd St, Broadway or the Port Authority.

The staff at this hotel treats you like you are their family. They are very helpful, kind, and professional. They printed out tickets for me for my boat tour, as well as our boarding passes. They were always available to answer questions and give directions. They basically anticipated any needs a traveler might have. I plan on always staying at this hotel when visiting NYC. Its location,(about a 15 minute walk to Times Square), the large and comfortable rooms, and a staff that surpasses any I’ve met elsewhere, are more than reasons enough to stay here.","June 15, 2018","25    Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Midtown West

1429,"Dont know where to start. You know when you check out, and are asked ""how was your stay"" and you want to say ""disaster!"" but don't? To begin with, were told on the phone that weekend parking on street outside is ok, signage says otherwise for saturday, but sunday is fine. There's a police station nearby and they have signs for them. There is construction nearby in the yards and a building across the street. Its busy on 10th = noise. We arrived early and dropped off luggage to get to business at Javitts and were told 'guarantee' room ready by 1pm. 2 pm came and went and no room. Then I had to come back to hotel because no one else in party was in the system and they needed my id, which they had already checked on checkin earlier. woman at desk was a real a$$ about it, or she was just a typical new yorker. Gave me a hard time when I asked to speak to manager. Was again told we would not be put in room facing yards/construction, and what were we given - you got it. In addition it was a handicap room. Went back down to change room and given the smallest room in the building - filled with a king size bed no less. I dont know how this passes fire inspection. We had just stayed the night before across the river in a Sheraton room which was literally four times the size of this room for less $. Asked for foam pillows 3-4 times, finally told they didnt have them. Heard a dog barking in the hotel, stairwell?? HVAC unit made a huge noise - unnecessary size in such a small room. If you changed the setting, it would switch back later that night to a preset and get warmer or colder. Some a-hole employee in the lobby (concierge?) asked my girlfriend if I was ""her boss""! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!! Like I was a pimp or something?? Altho its a new hotel in a close location to Javitts take my earnest advice and stay anywhere else.

It's also away from the craziness of some locations like Times Square, which isn't that far away (1 subway stop or I prefer to walk). It's part of the changing west side driven by the Hudson Yards development but still manages to be in a quiet little block. Great little restaurants on 9th Avenue. There is a small restaurant and bar/lounge area adjacent to the lobby; very cozy. The rooms are better furnished than most Four Points in NYC and I've stayed at most of them. The front desk staff is wonderful! Special kudos to: Bernice, Danny, Natasha, Eddie, Patrick, Michael, Alejandro, Marcos, & Seth!

If I stand in the middle of the bed, I can touch all 4 walls (I thought to myself, maybe that’s why it’s called four points! Because I can touch all four walls from the center of the room).Keep in mind that as a gold member, I am entitled to a free upgrade when available.It just so happens that a friend of mine is also staying at the same hotel. Upon visiting his room, I found that it was a regular NY hotel room that one would expect. The difference was that he booked his on Priceline and paid less for the room!So not only did I not get the upgrade that I was entitled to (a better room was available and for sale on Priceline). I could have been in a better room for a lower price by booking through Priceline.Oh. I almost forgot. I did get a free bottle of water!!!!!My advice is: 1.

We didnt visit but there is a bar and restaurant just off the lobby. The property is two blocks from the Hudson Yards station and maybe a 5 minute walk to Penn Station. Being from this city I expected an uncomfortable stay, hearing other lodgers and the noisy street. The hotel is on a quiet block and the walls are thick. No complaints.","December 21, 2017","25    Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Midtown West

1450,"After staying many times at four points on 40th and Elements on 39th, I must say that this four points on 35th&10 surpases both of them by a very large margin in terms of quality. It feels a lot more modern, the room service is very fast and all 4 meals I had were very satisfying, except maybe for the in-room breakfast that was just ""ok"". Heat/AC runs strong but the controls are limited (vent always at max = noisy, and the temperature keeps reseting = anoying), but I've seen much worst, just a small detail really and nothing that would keep me from going back. At last, regarding the location, it is more practical than I expected, with the subway station only minutes away (penn on 35th/8).

But the hotel itself turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. First, it was nice to check into a boutique hotel - one without a big, loud lobby. The staff was very efficient and friendly. I was given a corner queen suite which is one of the nicest I've every had in my many trips to the city. It was beautifully furnished with big windows overlooking Park Ave. The bathroom also had a window, which I love for natural light. Everything was beautifully appointed and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the turn down service with chocolates was a nice touch. Since the city was in the midst of a heat wave, it was always pleasant to make my way back to this hotel and be greeted by a smiling doorman holding the door open and iced fruit water in the lobby.

1479,"We stayed at this ideally located, cozy and comfortable hotel from May 11-18, 2019. We booked a King Deluxe and were given a room in the interior of the building for added quiet. After unpacking, we turned on the TV and discovered the channels would switch and the volume would change without our control. We called the front desk for help. The maintenance person rebooted the system but it continued and he informed us that there is a problem with the TV’s responding to other remotes in the core of the building and that they were aware but it had yet to be fixed. We booked for 7 nights and we didn’t feel this was acceptable. The front desk offered to move us but informed us we may still encounter the same problem. As there were no other comparable rooms available in the rest of the hotel, we were prepared to find another hotel. My husband went down to the front desk to ask if there was anything that could be done. Melanie wanted to make it right and realizing we had booked for 7 nights she upgraded us to a larger and beautiful Premier Park Avenue room (Room 415). Melanie even sent up a bottle of wine to apologize for the inconvenience, which we gratefully drank during our uninterrupted episode of Game of Thrones! We were so happy to remain in this comfortable and quiet hotel! Just a shout out to Leidy too for the pleasant chat during our check out. All the employees we encountered from the housekeeping staff, doormen, concierge and front desk were very friendly and helpful all the time. Love your bright, cozy and welcoming front lobby. Oh and such quiet air conditioning. I hope you fix the TV cable problem. And one other suggestion for you. I booked knowing you did that you did not have a restaurant. We unfortunately failed to notice until our last day that you did offer room service through Butler Hospitality and other delivery options. There were a few times that we were hungry but too tired to go out for food. It would have been helpful to be informed of your food delivery options when we checked in.

1483,"The hotel is good. They have a timely response to concerns, friendly staff and concierge, doorman and a well located hotel. If you just gloss over the review and read the title then it sums up the stay. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the hotel as a hotel. A place to stay and it is friendly welcoming and does what it needs to do. The issue and reasoning why the review is not 5* is for the fact that it is advertised as a luxury hotel which for what I received was not luxury. The room was within the realms of the hotels age as it should be. It was aged and was fairly small. The furniture was worn and had signs of its age. There is of course nothing wrong with that. The shower was in a tiny bath and the bath room lacked the luxury feel. Everything in the room was extra, tempting as the sweets and treats left on the shelf were not complementary which were covered in dust (clearly no one else was willing to pay 8$ for some sweets). The room just looked a bit sad and unloved. There was no room to put clothes other than one small bedside table and a pokey wardrobe that housed a very cramped space with a safe, ironing board, slippers, iron (which left little room for anything else). Having raised my thoughts to the management at the time. They admitted that the hotel was under a renovation program and that some rooms had and some rooms hadn’t been renovated and that it was being undertaken in phases. I was welcomed to revisit in future when the renovations have been complete and look forward to returning back to enjoy this soon!","May 14, 2019","26    IBEROSTAR 70 Park Avenue Hotel

AND if it wasn't for David we wouldn't of known they were filming for a new movie right around the corner, so we got to see that! our room was on the front side of the hotel so our view was very neat with the city in the distance, it was the perfect size for me and my husband and the bed was comfy!

1537,"The Hotel Mimosa is now my ""go-to"" hotel in New York City. I come to the city three or four times a year and look for a place which is clean an economical. I've stayed in many different hotels in Manhattan, but this is my favorite. It's like a European family inn, and I know by experience. The staff are friendly and efficient. If you need something, they will follow through. You will have a unique experience in Chinatown, because the owner will help you decide where to eat, as he grew up there. He will recommend not only a good Chinese restaurant, but the restaurant which serves the kind of Chinese food which is their specialty. Okay, that's food. As for the Arts, the owner can direct you to what's happening in the city as far as painting, music, opera, theater, etc. And by the way, the rooms are quiet at night, street noises will not wake you up, as often happens at other places in the city. In sum, I can tell you that staying at the Hotel Mimosa will not only be pleasant, but will result in a broader experience of New York than you could possibly have with glossy tourist pamphlets as a guide.","March 1, 2019","27    Hotel Mimosa New York

1574,"I knew that we were sharing a bathroom in the hall with strangers, so expected the stray pubic hair here and there... but they really need to get a better quality toilet seat that won't slip around on the commode! Also, the heat is turned way too high (charming old building with no room thermostat). There was not a single chair in our room, and we had to turn sideways to get around the bed. Not at all a romantic scenario. Last, but not least in my book, there was powdered cream for coffee in the morning. Although we stayed here 10 years ago and obviously enjoyed it, we won't be back after this stay.","December 2, 2018","28    Colonial House Inn

The rooms range from small to luxurious - we had a nice room with a beautiful bathroom and were very happy. The little lounge is a nice place to hang out after a day of trekking around the city, especially with the offer of a drink. The neighbourhood is delightful, with great places to eat. You're near everything - there's a fabulous view of the Empire State building at the end of the street.

1579,"I must admit it's difficult to know what to say about this place. It was not what I expected but maybe I didn't read the description closely enough when I booked it.What surprised me was that my room didn't have a bathroom or toilet ( although some rooms do, I believe) and was quite small. Also there is no elevator and you have to drag your case up to 3 or 4 flights of stairs if you are on the upper floors. I was told that the City doesn't allow this historic building to be modified hence no elevator. In fact you also have to climb a number of steps outside to get to the entrance.Having said all that, there are some redeeming features. The staff are friendly and helpful, there is a reasonable help- yourself breakfast included, free coffee and snacks are available 24h and there are alcoholic drinks available (I think for free but I didn't partake) during a happy hour. It is also conveniently located for shops restaurants and subway stations.In conclusion, however, I think that at $220 a night for a small room with no bathroom and no elevator is a high price to pay even in New York. Be cautious when booking this place.","September 19, 2018","28    Colonial House Inn

1580,"After arriving from my direct non-stop 5-hour flight from Vancouver to Newark, I took the subway from Penn Stn. in Manhattan on New Jersey transit's train service, to the 23rd St. E-line subway stop and it is only a 5 minute wallk to the hotel! Great location, which helped right off the bat, since I used the E-line often. Tip: buy a 7-day NY subway pass for $32 - it saved me money after 2-3 days of using the subway anywhere.Once I arrived at the hotel, the staff member was friendly and checked me in. I had the Superior room, which was great with ensuite bathroom and shower - deadbolt lock for the room was a little noisy when opening or closing it - only a minor detail, if your neighbour noticed.Nice rooftop for having a drink or even eating when ordering take out and bringing it back to eat...it was hardly used during the 4 days I was there - partly due to the rain but nonetheless, it was a nice touch!Breakfast was nice in the morning with good coffee...guests were friendly and overall, I would definitely come back again - hopefully, next year! Nice staff and well-kept. Lots of mom and pop restaurants within a 5-10 minute radius of the hotel and a few grocery places, too. I would highly recommend this hotel, with its great pricing and overall satisfaction of staying here. I especially loved hanging out on the roof when not doing touristy things during the day - great a night to see part of the Manhattan skyline!","September 9, 2018","28    Colonial House Inn

1583,"Colonial House Inn was a very affordable, friendly bed & breakfast that I recently stayed at on my NYC trip. Great location, only 1.5 blocks from a subway line (C & E). The front desk staff was very welcoming yet efficient.I booked a superior guestroom so I could have my own bathroom. The sleeping area was surprisingly large for a room in New York. The bathroom, however, was very small, similar to a bathroom on a cruise ship. Not a problem for me since I'm used to it, but be advised. Also, because it is an older building the A/C was via window units instead of central A/C. My room was on the ""terrace"" level; I don't mind street noises while trying to sleep, but if that's an issue I'd see if it's possible to be on a different floor.Continental breakfast was from 6 am to 10 am every morning. The front desk staff also said there was a happy hour in the afternoons, but I was unable to make it.I recommend Colonial House as a solo traveler and would stay there again.","July 23, 2018","28    Colonial House Inn

1584,"Loved this place. One of the best places we've stayed. Our family of four (mom, dad, 2 teenagers) stayed in the West End Suite. It had its own bathroom and plenty of room to spread out. The kids had their own space in the sitting room w/ their beds and our king sized bed was in its own room at the back. The place was surprisingly quiet, especially for an old building in the heart of NYC. I slept like a rock every night, and I'm rather finicky that way. The front desk folks are always friendly and helpful with directions and recommendations. The location can't be beat - a block from the nearest subway station, 10 blocks to Penn, a couple blocks the other way is the Highline. Definitely will stay here again.","July 15, 2018","28    Colonial House Inn

1585,Went to NYC for a show but didn't want to stay in the theatre district so we chose this hidden gem in the Chelsea section. About a mile walk straight up 8th to get to everything you want to see. Room included a happy hour with a wide assortment of beverages - we had two big glasses of wine. Continental breakfast also came with the room and was just perfect. It's located close to the High Line park which we walked. Overall a great experience and we will most definitely be back! ,"July 10, 2018","28    Colonial House Inn

1588,"I needed a place to stay in Chelsea while dealing with a family matter. Many of the big chains have properties in or near Chelsea now and I've stayed in several, but what a pleasant surprise to find Colonial House just down the block! We stayed in the West End Suite, which is effectively a one-bedroom apartment with living room, kitchen, and private bathroom. The bed was firm but comfortable and while the bathroom was small, the space available in the suite was enormous (particularly for New York) - the high ceilings make it seem even bigger. The staff is courteous and available 24/7 - you must be buzzed in to the building at all times. Continental breakfast was perfectly serviceable if not ""gourmet"" and happy hours each evening provided a welcome respite. If you need to leave your luggage before checking in or after checking out, the staff is more than happy to oblige.As others have said, the location is great - one block from a subway; 15 minute walk to Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. Minutes from Chelsea Market, the High Line, the Meatpacking District and Greenwich Village.The price for our suite compares very favorably with chain hotel prices for rooms that are much smaller (and don't come with breakfast or a happy hour).Be advised - there is no elevator, and there is a reasonably steep staircase just to get in the front door. (The staff will help carry luggage if you ask.) Believe me when I say it was worth climbing a few stairs for the comfortable stay.","June 13, 2018","28    Colonial House Inn

1597,"The Colonial House Inn is a traditional brownstone located in the Chelsea neighborhood. I stayed in a room with a double bed; the bathroom/shower was a short distance down the hall. I never had difficulty accessing the bathroom and the shower is excellent. There is also a hairdryer, mirror, and magnifying mirror mounted to the wall in the bathroom. There was a sink in the room. The bed was comfortable; the linens were soft and there were lots of pillows. They have housekeeping service daily. The hotel is non-smoking. The Inn offers breakfast between 7:00am-10:00am every day. It’s filling since they have boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, and an assortment of bagels, muffins, and other breads. Coffee, tea, and juice are also available. In the evening, the Inn offers happy hour with an assortment of alcohol. Tea and coffee are available all day long. Each time you enter the Inn, you will need to push a button beside the outside door to be allowed in. I thought this was a great safety feature. It’s easy to access the subway and buses from this location. The neighborhood is quiet and there are lots of restaurants nearby. Note that if you have mobility issues, there is no elevator. (You might also want to pack light to avoid lugging heavy luggage up and down the stairs.) Also note that the Inn has a less liberal cancellation policy. Cancellations or modifications to reservations must be made more than 14 days prior to arrival. Since they are a small property (22 rooms), this helps them to guarantee boomings. They suggest getting travel insurance in case your plans change. In sum, this was a great place to stay.","March 19, 2018","28    Colonial House Inn

1612,I stayed at the Gem Guest House 9/29/2017 - 10/1/2017. I booked a two beds bedroom with shared bathroom. The staff is very friendly. They serve breakfast every morning till 10am. They also offer happy hour with wine and snacks around 5pm. There are only about 40 rooms. My room was at the 3rd floor and though I picked share bathrooms there was never an issue/there is a full bathroom in the floor with shower and another 1/2 bathroom. The guest house also has a roof top where I went to see the sunset I highly recommend this place,"October 12, 2017","28    Colonial House Inn

We have been to New York many times and usually stay in large hotels, but The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea is a great alternative to those. The staff took great care of us, and we felt so at home. We had a two room suite for my husband and I and our two young adult sons. It was perfect. Also we loved the cozy dining room. The breakfast was plentiful and well-thought out, well-displayed and delicious.

Additionally, the breakfast in the second floor common area/library offered delicious selection of breakfast foods, such as bagels, croissants, muffins, breads, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, cereal, oatmeal, coffee and juice. We really enjoyed staying here and will definitely be returning! Whoever wrote a negative review disparaging this establishment obviously would pick apart every place they stayed in!!

The continental breakfast is perfect--the bagels and croissants are delicious and the ""honor"" bar is a nice touch for other times of the day. I have zero complaints. I hardly saw the managers, but when I needed something there was always someone to take care of things. My room was in the back of the hotel which was great as it could not have been more quiet.

1620,"My wife and I stayed here last Thursday. This is our favorite place to stay in Chelsea. It is more of a B&B than a hotel. The manager Eric welcomed us and let us check in slightly early, though we just asked to only drop our bags off. We were greeted by his friendly pair of Bulldogs, Sofie and Max. The library area on the second floor is so warm and inviting, you just want to have a cup of tea, and sit and watch the people go by on the street. There are plenty of books and magazines to read. The continental breakfast is fantastic, with 3 types of breads, bagels, cereal, fresh fruits, yogurts, fresh made jellys, coffee, and tea. This area is not as crazy and crowded like 42nd st, yet close to the subway, only 3 stops from Port Authority. The bedrooms are roomy, with nice brick wall accents. The bathrooms are modern and clean, along with great hot water for showers. The place is normally booked up, so you must reserve early. This is a must place to stay. I highly recommend staying here when you are in Chelsea, or even going for a play. I guarantee if you stay once, you will be back again.","December 21, 2018","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

1621,Great little place and very quaint and clean. Booked it on Expedia which was a big mistake as very strict 30 day booking policy. Could not shorten our stay by one day due to medical reasons though 28 days out we called. . Tried calling but the policy had no flexibility as far as we were told. I now know I should have spoke to the owner directly. Owner called me when I left an Expedia review and I talked to him. He said I should have called Expedia to make any changes but my wife had talked to manager who said no go so we left it at that. ( when we called to see if three nights could be shortened to two ) I thought the place was great but the owner was not very nice when he was giving me a hard time on the phone. I gave 5/5 stars but left info on the strict policy which he did not appreciate. Just trying to help out fellow travellers. Great place non the less ! Would recommend it!

1623,"This is certainly not a shiny, modern, 24-hour manned boutique hotel, but that was one of the reasons we chose it. The room we had at the side of the hotel overlooked the adjacent empty church which made the room a bit gloomy during the day, but at least it was quiet, and we were out and about most of the time. The room was a good size, eccentrically furnished, had a couple of stains on the carpet and a shower control that threatened to fall off at any time, but we expected that sort of quirkiness, so it didn’t detract from our stay. The included breakfast was more than adequate, with juices, coffee, cereals, and very good pastries and this is taken in the cosy and bright dining area at the front of the hotel and your proximity to the other guests makes it inevitable that you chat with them and exchange tips on places to visit and things to do in NYC. Eric, the owner also encourages you to use this area for eating your own food that you might have brought in or had delivered to the hotel and, if you’ve forgotten the wine or beer, you can get them from the honesty bar along with miscellaneous snacks. Eric is also a very good source of tourist information and gave us various tips on getting around and what local restaurants to try. The hotel is only a couple of mins. from subway stations and less than 15 mins. walk to The Highline, so very conveniently located. We had four days in NYC and staying at the Townhouse Inn made our stay that much more memorable and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again.","November 1, 2018","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

1624,"Lots of positives about the Townhouse Inn. The rooms were definitely bigger than typical NYC hotel rooms, and we heard very little street noise. Since this is an old townhouse it has a lot of charm to it--think of ""shabby chic"" furnishings and some interesting nooks and crannies. We had everything we needed for breakfast and the breakfast room itself was nicely furnished and relaxing to hang out in. The honor bar stocked a lot of items that were shockingly inexpensive. There weren't any real downsides other than while the sheets were clean the bedskirt was visibly dirty--the staff might want to change those more often. There isn't really a ""front desk"" with visible staff so you'll want to plan to call or text the innkeeper if you need something. A very nice alternative to a regular hotel in a great central Manhattan location.","October 14, 2018","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

1625,"I would have had only nice things to say for the Townhouse Inn of Chelsea, had it not been for the lock failing on the front door on a Friday night at 1am that forced me to find another hotel.I spent the following 2.5 hours after getting locked out trying to call the manager, Eric, but got nothing but voicemail. A couple was also trying to get in at the same time, but their key, my key and the keys from the lockbox were all failing to let us in. After realizing that Eric would not pick up the phone, I went to a nearby hotel (the FourPoints around the corner offered me a decent deal) and got 4 hours of sleep before having to head back to the Townhouse Inn to pack up in time for 11am checkout. Upon arriving the following morning, the on-site staff noted that they would not be able to negotiate any compensation for the hardship and that they would reach out to Eric to see what could be done. The on-site manager later informed me that Eric stated I would get the night refunded and that I would get a call to organize the refund, but it has been 4 days without a call. Eric also seems to conveniently not be onsite when I call, so time will tell how this plays out.Aside from this experience and from what I'm reading in other reviews indicating a horrible experience based on management, the place was a decent deal in a good location with decent amenities... as long as you don't mind being unexpectedly homeless on a Friday night.","October 10, 2018","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

1626,This inn is located quite centrally on 23rd St between 5th and 6th avenue. The 1 train that will take you South to Battery Park or North to Times Square and Central Park is at the end of the block - so that's just perfect.The hosts are very nice. They are welcoming and helpful. The breakfast is very good and is immediately restocked as things are eaten. There's lots to choose from too. The rooms are older and large. Our bed was large and decently comfortable. I'm not a fan of bedspreads so that was a bit of a negative. I don't like to think about who was on that bedspread last.Though right on a busy street it was reasonably quiet.The bathroom was a bit on the small side and the water pressure a bit low. It was also a bit wacky as far as holding temperature - it would wander a bit so you had to be cautious between too hot and too cold.All in all we really enjoyed our stay here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to our friends.,"September 28, 2018","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

1628,"Up until we checked in things appeared to be fine......I emailed Eric Ord (general manager) and asked if we could leave our luggage there, (we arrived early) until 3pm when we would be able to check in. Eric graciously said ""no problem"". When we arrived at 10:30 Eric met us, introduced his husband, and then excitedly told us that due to a cancellation they ""upgraded"" us to a suite! Sounded good......until we arrived at 3 to check-in at which point we walked into our ""upgraded"" room to find out it was NOT what we specifically requested! My reservations were for a ""Deluxe King"" room, which was confirmed, and the ""suite"" we were ""upgraded"" to only had a ""queen size"" bed that was not only NOT a deluxe but their website doesn't even include that bed in their ""look at me"" pictures! (Guess I wouldn't post that bed either if it was me) What Eric considers an ""upgrade"", even in the smallest sense of the word, doesn't comply with what is normal and reasonable. When I went to talk to whomever was in charge at that particular moment, she told me that the room we had reserved and paid for was already rented out. Thought it was interesting that it had been rented that fast but, still asked if she would call and ask those guests if they would mind exchanging rooms as they obviously had JUST checked in, afterall it would be an ""upgrade""!....according to Eric! WRONG! Turns out those guests had rented the room the night before and then asked if they could stay an extra night. Eric said ""yes"" WITHOUT asking us if we had any objections! Apparently he felt that he could ""upgrade"" us to a smaller bed and we wouldn't notice! There is a reason I requested a Deluxe King, AND paid for it in advance! When someone who claims to be the General Manager, does something like this and then does not make any attempt to contact us to say ""I'm sorry"" or ""please, is there anything I can do to make it up to you""........it says alot about his way of doing business! I find it interesting that the ""The General Manager"" Eric made himself scarce so that there was no face to face possibility (the young lady manning the front desk told us she talked to Eric and he explained that there was no ""King"" request) so I know he was aware of the situation!!! I cannot warn enough people to stay away from this so-called Inn/hotel/b&b. Room #51 was NOT what anyone who pays good money would call or accept as enjoyable. The A/C unit near the ceiling leaked and caused us to put a trash can under the leak so as to catch the water. The TV was a tube tv from the 1980's/1990's and was somewhere between a 19""-24"" in an armoire......THAT was interesting.....not to mention the 2 remotes that it took to operate it. The bathroom towel bar fell off as soon as my wife reached for a washcloth. The tub leaves you standing in water as the tub DOES NOT drain properly. (There is another post that warns about that but we chose to ignore it)......THAT was a mistake on our part! The bed mattress was so well used, there was no way to escape the valley in the center. The bed frame was so loose it literally felt like it was going to fall apart. This was supposed to be a very special weekend for my wife and I.......the experience at this b&b is nothing I ever wish to remember. I've noticed that others who left less than stellar reviews may have done things that could have caused management to respond to their complaints by explaining what the guests did that created the problem. I'm interested to see what Eric says about this!....since we did nothing but follow the guidelines and policies set down from the beginning! What an unprofessional and disappointing experience.","August 13, 2018","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

We had no real view but I appreciated the quiet at night. It's a great street because it's not super busy so it is quiet at night. Lovely breakfast and I think we were the youngest people in the hotel but that was also nice as we aren't a rowdy bunch. They let us leave our bags when we arrived early and left late. Such a fun visit to the city. I will definitely seek them out again for future visits.,"February 25, 2018","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

Our spacious room on the W 23rd Street side had a very comfortable bed and Ann endlessly fascinating view at all hours. (You might find the back side rooms quieter if street noose is a problem.

1646,"I stayed here for 1 night with my husband. It is a cute boutique hotel in the heart of Chelsea. It was very reasonably price and overall we enjoyed our stay. We stayed in a room with a King bed and it was huge (for Manhattan). It was more of a suite with an area with a couch. This would be really nice if you have kids because it offers a lot of space to move about. The rooms and hotel and decorated sorta like your visiting your grandma (not in a good or bad way). The bed and pillows weren't as comfy as your more standard hotels. The TV was small and looked like it was from the 1990's, but we didn't plan on watching TV so it didn't really matter. The shower pressure could have been better. You can hear street noise from our spot on the 4th floor, but it didn't hinder our sleep too much. The windows didn't have black out curtains so if you plan on sleeping in really late with a hangover this may be a problem. The breakfast is a continental breakfast with assorted pastries (awesome croissants), bagels, spreads, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, cold cereal, juice, coffee. It wasn't anything extravagant but it definitely got the job done and helps you save on food in NYC and offering a quick and convenient option to start your day. I would recommend this spot to friends.","January 22, 2018","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

1648,"Stayed from Saturday to Tuesday and my thanks to Eric and his staff for their helpfulness and friendliness. Nothing was a problem (other than the traffic to the airport, but they had arranged a car at a suitable time, so this didn't stress us). Greeted at the door by Eric and his two friendly bulldogs, we were then looked after at the reception desk by Fergie, who is just delightful and welcoming. Our room was a fair size and everything worked fine although the TV-cable system is a challenge. Bed and bathroom were ok and everything was spotless. We loved the breakfast which consisted of fresh bakery products, fruit and cereals, plus juices and beverages. An honour bar operates all day and night should anyone manage to go hungry in this fantastic area of NYC, which has numerous restaurants of all shapes and sizes. The hotel/inn/b&b (or whatever you wish to call it) is midway between two metro stations and bus stops, so everything is very close and we thoroughly enjoyed this buzzy neighbourhood.","November 29, 2017","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

1649,"The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea is sort of a New York City anachronism. It’s a 14 room inn that melds a hotel and an Airbnb experience. Those are hard to find in Manhattan especially considering its prime location. Any airport is a mere one or so hour distance via public transit (forget taxis – they will likely take longer). It’s quirky in a sort of fond but sometimes exasperating way. For instance, to get into the Inn you will need to get an email telling you about the key-code to get past the front door upon check-in. If you miss the email or have less than great dexterity (the key code is to a key lock box) you will be frustrated. Fortunately, my colleague went past that experience and just let me in when I arrived – you might not be so fortunate. Once inside you will be taken aback that the inn works on the honor system. If you take anything from the available snacks, beer, wine, etc; they only ask you note it down on a sticky note. Prices are beyond reasonable. That’s absolutely refreshing given today’s untrusting world. My room (#42) was spacious and the well appointed bathroom was very large. It took a bit of effort to prevent the shower curtain from enveloping my body (hint: wet it down first). The décor was definitely stuck in the 60’s. Even so, the bed was satisfying and nothing other than the décor could possibly offend you. Alternatively, you might be even excited about it! That said, the rooms are really up to today’s standards. The free Wi-Fi is adequate for Skype video calls. Normally, breakfast is included in the hotel rate and it’s about as good as you would get in Europe along with the period French classic music. Frankly, I found it quite enjoyable. Prices vary but if you book early enough you can get this little gem for much less than any other hotel in the area. Of course, whether you like it or not depends on what you are looking for. If you want a sure die hard frontal experience, then this is not it. If you want an eclectic, easy going, but ultimately satisfying experience then the Townhouse Inn of Chelsea is the place to stay.","November 24, 2017","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

1651,"Early October we had the great pleasure of going to NYC on vacation. Usually, it can be a rather expensive and disappointing experience as hotels in the city can be overpriced and often low standard. But at this occasion we found an affordable place with charm and great location. Located on West 23rd Street between 6th and 7th Avenue in a neighborhood with lots of restaurants, stores and bars, in walking distance of a variety of attractions and with public transportation just outside the door, The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea is recommendable place to stay. The Inn itself is quite small, but has a lot of charm. The owner Eric and his staff (including 2 very nice dogs) are relaxed, service minded and helpful. In the cozy public area of the Inn a good continental breakfast is served daily. There is alway fresh brewed coffee ready for you. And on a we trust you pay basis it is possible to grab water, sodas, beer etc around the clock. Not at hotel rate, but at store rate. It is a place we will be sure to consider for our next visit to NYC. I can only recommend you give Eric a call to hear about vacancies for you next trip to the city.

The inn was perfect and shocking to even know this place existed in Manhattan. Eric was friendly and accommodating. Eric's devotion to this Inn makes it the place it is. The breakfast area with its original windows is stunning. The breakfast was perfect as well as the honor system for water and snacks is a rare find. I am already planning another trip.

After getting the information about the building, I went to room 42. The room was very large. Yes, the furniture is older but still comfortable and functional, but you do get mints on your day of check in! All day coffee and tea are nice. The morning cold breakfast was good, I would suggest that breakfast times be a little longer than 2 hours.

1655,"We had a lovely stay at the Townhouse Inn just before Labor Day 2017. You can't beat the location, it is 2 blocks away from 4 subway lines and right near the Flatiron Building and Madison Square Park. There are lots of markets and shops in the area, the High Line and Chelsea Market are and easy walk. We liked Brooklyn Bagel on 8th Ave as the best bagels we had on this trip. We got in on the red eye from San Francisco and dropped our bags off at the Inn at 7am. We then did the same for our late flight upon check out, picking up our bags at 5pm on our way back to JFK. Staff was polite, but don't expect a homey B&B.Our room 42 was nice and roomy (as others have commented). We liked the ample shelves and storage throughout. You can tell the Inn was renovated in the last 10 years, however there were a few cosmetic issues that looked like they were in need of deferred maintenance. Housekeeping did a nice job each day as we returned to a made up room.The included breakfast was well done with great Croissants from Maison du Macaron across the street. New Yorkers hate half and half, so we made due with milk in our coffee. Their bagels were not boiled at breakfast, so again head to Brooklyn Bagel or Murray's nearby for those. The library was one of the most distinctive things about the Inn- we made nightly use of the ice machine and very fairly priced honor bar for water, beers, and snacks.All and all a great and fairly priced place to stay. Our 4 nights cost about $1,000. We would definitely return.","September 4, 2017","29    The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea

It is definitely bigger than most NYC apartments. We were on one of the top floors and barely could hear any traffic or noise from the outside. They offer tea and coffee free of charge throughout the day and small snacks and refreshments including beer and wine based on the honest system. The owner really takes pride in making everyone feel welcome and offers assistance in suggesting places to see and do. Breakfast is awesome!!!! This is an older building so of course the pipes are old and heating and water pressure could be an issue for some but everyone should take this into consideration before booking this type of hotel. The owner will give you extra blankets and space heaters upon request. This is definitely a place I will visit again.

1657,"We are a couple who looks for places to stay that are a bit out of the ordinary, have some character and are not the typical corporate box hotels where everything looks the same. If this is also you, then this is the place for you to stay in NYC. We loved the fact that we were arriving late, could get our key and could come and go as we wanted for the 3 nights and 4 days we were there. In fact we hardly saw a person except when we checked out. We had one of the bigger rooms which was great for spreading out and feeling at home. We didn't spend a lot of time taking in the other amenities such as the breakfast or honor bar but everything looked tip top. We had the room that faces 23rd street so there was quite a bit of street noise but after all, you don't come to NYC for peace and quiet. If you are a fussy sleeper ask for a quieter room. A couple small things that we forgot to mention at checkout; one of the bedside lamps was missing a bulb and the hair dryer only worked on low the last day so it may need replaced.

Not only does the room have 10ft celings. But the walls are exposed brick. The rooms give you the feel of Victorian era, with antique furniture in the room. The king bed we had was comfortable and quiet, we slept like babies. What is also amazing is the room had a modern bathroom with nice sink and shower, along wit plenty of shampoo and conditioner for the guest.

1659,"Who wouldn't love to stay in a castle that has been converted into a charming boutique inn located in the middle of Manhattan? The Townhouse Inn of Chelsea is a very lovely and unique inn that is beautifully and tastefully decorated in which guests can enjoy a delightful selection of delicious breakfast items every morning (for free); snacks and drinks throughout the day (honor system!); and, evening wine and cheese. Guests need not worry about ""modern"" accommodations as they are plentiful including free WiFi, in-room hair dryers and satellite TV. Conveniently located, public transportation is available just steps away from the inn's front door. For those who dare to drive into NYC, a public access parking garage is located just up the street. You will definitely want to ask Eric Ord, General Manager, about where to eat as his recommendations were fantastic ... all within walking distance of the inn. And, you are in for a real treat if you're staying at the inn when Sophie and Max are around ... the inn's English Bulldogs. They are the raspberries on top of the trifle!

1674,"It's very difficult for me to review this B&B. On one hand the accommodation itself was great - the room was spacious and clean. Upon our arrival we found home made cookies on our bed that were so delicious. So cool idea! We had a room n. 4 on the second floor, it has its own bathroom which we really appreciated. If I'd reviewed only the accommodation, I'd give 5 stars. The neighborhood on the other hand deserves one star, maybe no star at all. It's Harlem and I should have probably known. But I didn't. The 125th street is a mess - there are people doing drugs on the corners, it stinks like urine - farther you go from Central Park the worse. I would strongly recommend to not walk there in the night, sometimes we had weird feeling walking there during the day. I can't understand why some people here say it is safe neighborhood. It's definitely not safe and I won't probably visit this place again, which I regret most, because the room was great and the staff was friendly, but we didn't feel safe.","September 13, 2017","30    Soul Food Mont Morris

1685,"This was a repeat visit, having stayed once before in May 2015. We were met on arrival by Paola, who helped us get our luggage inside. Since we were too early for check in she offered to watch our stuff while we went out and explored Harlem, and moved our stuff to our room when it was ready We had room 2, which has a private bath, is on the first floor as you come in to the building, and is quite roomy. There was also a refrigerator which was handy for my wife to store some of her meds that require refrigeration Two suggestions: it would be nice to have a dresser or armoire to put clothes in and a mirror above the desk, because the bathroom mirror is too small and lighting is not the best. There is a closet in the room but the shelves are up way too high to put much on them. Mont Morris at 3 W 123rd street is an old brownstone row house that is very clean, well maintained, and quiet. It's only 3 blocks from the subway line and an easy trip to midtown Manhattan to see all the sights. We also went to a free taping of Conan Obrien at the Apollo the day we arrived. Special thanks to Georgia for getting up at 5AM to help us walk our luggage to the M60 bus stop on 125th street for the half hour ride to La Guardia on the day of our departure. Above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you. The bus costs about $5 for 2 people and only takes a half hour to get there, compared to $50 for a taxi, so it is well worth it. We will most likely stay here on future visits because of the reasonable rates, the location, and the assistance of staff, particularly Paola and Georgia. Can't wait to come back again, maybe for Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, or at Christmas to see the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall. ","November 13, 2016","30    Soul Food Mont Morris

Although the location is quite far out from many of the sites I was visiting, it was easy to use the subway and it was a perfect base for my 3 days in New York, at a cost far more reasonable than other places I considered.

It was also very clean, roomy, and our particular room included a bonus little kitchenette and private patio of which we took advantage of on a nightly basis!! It is also very close to the subway which takes you to almost every ""touristy"" spot you would want to check out. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance of which we took full advantage of!! Casasotto, an Italian eatery close by, was our first dinner in the city and was fabulous!! If I could say anything to anyone who is making their first trip to the city, it would be that parking is extremely difficult to find! There are parking garages nearby but if you are lucky enough to find a spot along the street, keep in mind that two times per week they sweep the streets so you will have to move your car. This isn't a poor reflection of the property or city, just a tidbit of info that you will want to keep in mind! Our stay was great!

1715,"Stayed at Mont Morris on two occasions in September 2015. Both rooms were very well decorated, with plenty of space which i was not expecting in NY. The staff were extremely helpful when we need an early morning taxi or general things to do in NY.Th Hotel is only a 5 min walk from two Underground stations and the line is also an express line so takes around 15 mins to get to Central Square. there are also several restaurants near by and can recommend Ristorante Settepani on 120th for Happy hour drinks or a great meal with live Jazz musicI would thoroughly recommend staying here as found it value for money in a City where accommodation is expensive.","November 22, 2015","30    Soul Food Mont Morris

When we arrived it was halloween, and the hosts and the dog was dressed as police officers, and the place was decorates with spiders etc. You are always met with a smile from the host and the other guests. The rooms are big, and the place is always clean and you feel really safe at Mont Morris. We had a room turning to the street, and there was a bit noise when trucks came buy and when the trash was picked up. Therefore we recommend ear plugs.

1720,"Me and my boyfriend booked to stay in Mont Morris for 4 nights in September during our New York and Florida trip. I could not fault the accommodation. 1 minute walk from subway station, beautifully decorated rooms (had a sneaky peek at other rooms when they were empty and open and the lower the floor the more modern and newer the rooms). They are decorated in a very eclectic taste. Our room had a fridge which was very handy as we like to enjoy a glass of G&T after a whole day of walking. I would definitely come back to this guesthouse next time Im in New York. As per the location, Harlem might seem unsafe and in places the streets smelt of urine- yes, of urine! But no one bothered us when we were out. You have to balance it all out and for the price you pay its a small compromise to make to stay in Harlem. ","October 19, 2015","30    Soul Food Mont Morris

However what spoilt the stay was the filthy condition of the kitchen. It was great being able to do our own breakfasts and a few dinners, but not before we gave the kitchen a thorough cleaning. The fridge hadn’t been cleaned, the microwave was splattered with food, the stove and hot plates greasy and dirty. It really spoilt the stay as we never felt entirely at ease in the dirty kitchen. Even after contacting the owner and letting him know of the conditions, he did not bother replying or even acknowledging our email.

He will meet you when you arrive and answer any questions you may have, from how to get around to where the best place to get food. You are provided a key and you're ""home"". Speaking of food, there is a grocery store at the end of the block and a mini-fridge in your room to store snacks, drinks, etc. Of course, there are many restaurants in the area, so you don't have to go to the grocery store.

1729,"I really appreciated my stay at 255West - yes, it's not close to the sights so perhaps not the ideal location if you are in New York for the first time and focusing on sightseeing. However, for your next stay and all others after that - especially once you've figured out the subway and realise how easy it is to get downtown with the A - this is a perfect, affordable option. I loved the beautifully-preserved brownstone house, the decor of the room was impeccable, and in terms of cleanliness it was absolutely immaculate. The Calliope room I stayed in had buttery yellow walls and one exposed brick wall behind the bed, solid marble top bedsteads with turquoise ceramic lamps, an inset shelf lined with a few books and tasteful tchotchkes. I found it warm and pleasant and absolutely a place I could imagine myself living. The room was large and filled with natural light, the trees outside the two windows provided some privacy and birdsong in the morning, and everything was well laid out and well thought of. The bathroom was clean and also beautifully designed: a shower room with muted pastel tiles and polished fittings. The mattress and pillows were comfortable, the fridge was really nice-to-have, and the water bottles and chocolate as a welcome were a nice touch. The host was patient, friendly, and discreet... I could go on! I would not hesitate to return.","May 27, 2018","31    255West Guesthouse

1730,"I had never been to NYC before and was traveling out to see my second cousin, who lives in Harlem. The neighborhood doesn't offer too many options in terms of lodging and I was a little skeptical of going through AirBnB as you don't exactly know what you might get. The only brand name hotel that was fairly close by was aLoft in Harlem and that was around $210/nt for the weekend I was traveling. I found 255West for about $50/nt less and decided to go for it. I was so glad I did! Everything was very clean and James was very accommodating in making the check-in and check-out process seamless, even with a packed itinerary. The room was just as good as any hotel I could have found and everything was clean and fresh. There was very little noise and while the neighborhood isn't exactly the best in the city, I felt perfectly comfortable walking around on my own, even coming from a tiny town of just over 4,000 people in central California. All the major attractions of lower Manhattan are a short (less than 40 min) subway ride away and you can walk to Yankee Stadium in well under an hour, which was a huge plus for me! If I could improve on anything, I'd say they should modify booking through the website to just charge your card for the whole stay automatically at check-in, but James was able to email me an invoice to pay online for the difference, so I didn't have to make time to have him physically run my card. No harm, no foul. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to New York by themselves or with a companion! ","April 11, 2018","31    255West Guesthouse

1732,"I felt like I was at home during my stay here. The room was spacious, clean and in a quiet neighborhood. Short walk to local and express subways (30 minutes or less to Time Square), bus routes and near bars and restaurants. Though most of our time was spent in the mid and lower half of Manhattan, the distance from the ""action"" was no problem at all since we would be using the subway to get places anyway. Felt completely safe at all times even when walking from the subway late at night. James was there to greet us when we arrived and was very accessible throughout our stay with any requests we had. There is a full kitchen available to us which was a nice touch for storing and re-heating leftovers. Each room comes with a private bathroom but not all of them are attached to the rooms (some are in the hall) so make sure you check if that is a concern of yours. For the same price as closet sized run down hotels in the middle of the city, we were able to stay in a beautiful room with great hospitable hosts.

He waited for us outside and took our bags out of the car and showed us to our room. James is very knowledgeable about the area and was able to give us a few options of what restaurants to visit.

The room was lovely and spacious and had everything we needed for an enjoyable relaxing stay, including tea and coffee downstairs which we started our days out with. I thought the art and styling of the place was amazing! There is also a fully equipped kitchen in the communal area where you can store food in the fridge/freezer or cook if you like!The hosts were great, very welcoming and kept out our way but were easily available if we needed them and gave loads of helpful tips when it came to airport transport and local restaurants.I was a bit apprehensive about the area since this was our first visit to New York, however I would say it is fine, it has an interesting local vibe and is perfectly safe during the day. Night time was fine too, but we stuck to the main roads just incase. There are lots of great brunch spots around the area, we would especially recommend Amy Ruths for the waffles and chicken, and Patisserie des Ambassades for delicious croissants.The nearby 125th street subway has great connections for lower Manhattan and Brooklyn as this has both the local and express subway, but you can also go to 135th street for just local (slower) trains.The only real negative about the guesthouse was the internet was quite slow, which made it difficult to watch movies.Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it.","April 17, 2017","31    255West Guesthouse

From the aesthetics with decor, the structural design of the property and even more so with the privacy of my booked room and nearby bath-- both of which has the amenity of locking. My room was the Lily on the top level and I couldn't have been more pleased. I love a good sleigh bed and I loOove wood flooring. Comfort is never something one wants to sacrifice especially when traveling-- James' and Frank's property in no way let me down. I literally came and went as I saw fit with no awkward encounters in between-- before I knew it it was time to go :( I was quite satisfied with the location of the property as well-- as I set forth on foot on a numbers of adventures which would have been highly unpleasant if not impossible had I opted for some place not central to The city of Manhattan's attractions. I came to reconnect with old friends and left with new ones! Such a gem this brownstone is-- one gets to step into the city life of NYC from an authentic vantage point of accommodations in the city that look and feel as personable as that which could be occupied by close friends or family extending an invite.

1741,"As soon as Frank opened the door to welcome us, we knew we made the right choice. When he took us up the one flight of stairs to our room and opened the door, it was exactly as it looked in the pictures. We stayed in the Gino room and it's very spacious. You had a view over the back gardens and could open a window, which was a bonus during the unseasonly warm weather NYC was experiencing during our stay. It was wonderful to come home at the end of a long day of walking to relax in a nice deep hot bath. There was also a hand held shower over the bath, so we would to suggest that if you particularly like a shower only, this room isn't for you. The room was equipped with a small fridge, cable TV and iron and ironing board. There was a small couch and coffee table. The room was very warm and although extra blankets and pillows are also provided, we didn't need them. If you're going during the summer months, I would enquire about cooling. Tea and coffee is available in the communal dining room downstairs.Frank and James are available for any of your needs, however if you want to be left alone, they will not disturb you. We asked all the basic questions first up, and we're set to hit Manhattan. The tip on the quick way to the subway on 125th, saved lots of time, as it's an easy walk a few blocks north. The ABCD lines all operate from this stop and we were able to access all the places we wanted to visit from this line, crossing to other lines at major stops. The area was very quiet and we always felt safe. There's a large laundromat at the end of the street on Frederick Douglas.

This place is well worth a look, especially if you enjoy something different than the well-worn hotel experience.","July 6, 2016","31    255West Guesthouse

1749,The Gino room was just like the picture. The finishes in the room are very nice and the room was clean. They provide coffee and tea in the morning with to-go cups if you need it. Easy to get to the trains. We would stay again. ,"June 15, 2016","31    255West Guesthouse

1750,"What a great guesthouse! We loved our stay at 255West Guesthouse. James & Frank were most accommodating and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. We stayed in the Gino Room, which was most tastefully decorated. Bed was extremely comfortable, and lovely to have a fridge in the room. Coffee and tea always available in the reception area. great access to the New York Subway, and only a couple of stops away from Time Square! The neighbourhood also very quite, Without a doubt, we will stay at 255West Guesthouse again!","May 5, 2016","31    255West Guesthouse

1751,"When we got off the subway I was intimidated by the neighborhood -it's rough on the edges. We got used to it to some degree and never truly felt in danger. We found a great restaurant as well as a Cafe (Hyacinth’s Haven & Double Dutch Brothers Coffee) and saw plenty of other places we would of loved to try if time allowed. The house and room were comfortable & stylish. Near subway, location was practical. We had warm weather and slept with the windows open so we heard all sorts of sounds throughout the night -horns, arguments, yelling, etc. This we also got used to but be aware if you're a light sleeper.

1752,"I visited NYC last June so i should have got around to writing this earlier (sorry Frank). While it's true that staying in Harlem would not be as central as some would like, consider that you will get to see a side of NYC that you might otherwise have overlooked. A walk through the neighbourhood offers an authentic slice of New York and despite the fact that it exposes you to the reality of social deprivation much more so than the glossy, touristy areas (like in any major city) I found the locals respectful and courteous and I did not feel unsafe. The guesthouse itself is stunning. Tastefully decorated with an air of vintage charm blended with the grandiose. There's none of the self-conscious, feeling like you're in someone's house thing that can sometimes happen in British guesthouses, New Yorkers tend to have the same privacy sensibilities as Londoners and I only really saw Frank if I needed something. I had a wonderful time and I thoroughly recommend this charming guesthouse.","April 20, 2016","31    255West Guesthouse

1753,"We absolutely loved it here! The house is so beautifully designed. The location is perfect, close to the train and shops but tucked away on a quiet street. Thank you so much for making us feel at home. Frank and James are wonderful hosts and we can't wait to visit again!","March 17, 2016","31    255West Guesthouse

1754,"We stayed 4 days. The room was very nice and clean, the bathroom big and confortable. The location is strategic, since it is very close to 4-5 metro strations and 2 stops away from time square (with the express lines). Only one lack: the small stairs up to the second floor (with the big luggage it has been really hard to climb it up).","November 15, 2015","31    255West Guesthouse

1755,We stayed here for 3 nights during our stay in New York. The place is would seem far from downtown but it's merely 25 minutes away by subway. The queen room we chose was very nicely decorated with a beautiful bathroom with bathtub. The owners are very welcoming and there is free coffee downstairs.The only drawback is that there is not a very good choice of restaurants around.A very good option to stay in New York.,"August 18, 2015","31    255West Guesthouse

1756,"This guesthouse is perfekt for families, single travelers and couples. The beds are very comfortable, very nice bathroom and the interior is amazing! Very quiet! You have a 5-10 min walk to both the blue and the red subway and approx 15-20 min ride to Time Square. A supermarket around the corner. You can also find different places in the surroundings to eat breaky, lunch or dinner. I can really recommend this hotel!! We loved it and will absolutely stay there again!!","April 24, 2015","31    255West Guesthouse

1757,"Stayed for four nights, hosts charming - room lovely and much bigger than the chains a bit further in. Fast wifi in the rooms with tea and coffee in the lounge area. If you have a look at the zip code and see Harlem - don't worry it is perfectly safe and about 20 mins walk from the top of Central Park or 7 mins from the metro. We would happily stay here again.
